This guide, prepared by the Computational Matter Physics (CoMPhy) Lab, will help prospective applicants understand this prestigious opportunity and prepare competitive applications.

## Who can apply and from where

The scholarship targets PhD candidates from **42 eligible low and middle-income Commonwealth countries** as classified by the OECD Development Assistance Committee. [Opportunitiesforafricans +4](https://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/) From Africa, eligible countries include Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. Asian countries include Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The Pacific region includes Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, while the Caribbean includes Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, and Jamaica. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/)

To be eligible, you must already be **registered for a PhD at a university in one of these countries** by September 2025. [Opportunitiesforafricans +4](https://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/) Academic requirements include holding at least an upper second-class (2:1) honours degree, or a lower second-class degree plus a relevant Master's qualification. [Opportunitiesforafricans +4](https://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/) Crucially, you must demonstrate that you cannot afford UK study without this scholarship. [Opportunitiesforafricans +2](https://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/) There are no age limits, but you must be a citizen or have refugee status in an eligible country [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) and have been residing there for at least two years before applying. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/)

The most critical eligibility requirement is the **institutional link between your home university and Durham**. This must be a formal partnership at the departmental or institutional level - not merely a collaboration between individual researchers. [Cranfield](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/funding/funding-opportunities/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships)[Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) Both your home supervisor and proposed Durham supervisor must provide supporting statements detailing this partnership. [Opportunitiesforafricans +4](https://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/)

## Navigate the application timeline and process

Applications open annually in **October and close in mid-December** (16:00 GMT). [Britishcouncil](https://study-uk.britishcouncil.org/scholarships-funding/commonwealth-scholarships)[Britishcouncil](https://www.britishcouncil.in/study-uk/scholarships/commonwealth-scholarships) For the 2025/26 cycle, applications have already closed on December 16, 2024, with results expected by July 2025 for September 2025 start. [Opportunitiesforafricans +2](https://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/) Mark these dates for future cycles as the timeline remains consistent yearly.

The application process is **entirely online through CSC Central**, the official CSC application system. [Scholardigger](https://www.scholardigger.com/post/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026)[Opportunitiesforafricans](https://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/) You apply directly - no nomination from your university or government is required. [Fcdo +2](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) Start your application at least 6 months before the deadline to allow time for securing supervisor agreements, gathering documents, and crafting your proposal.

Your application journey involves first identifying a Durham supervisor whose research aligns with your interests, then confirming the institutional link exists between universities. Next, secure supporting statements from both supervisors and gather all required documents. Complete the online application including your research proposal and development impact statement. Upload all documents in the correct format (PDF preferred, maximum 5MB per file) [Opportunitydesk](https://opportunitydesk.org/2024/11/20/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/) and ensure your referees submit their references by the deadline. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/)

## Compile essential documentation

Documentation requirements are strict - missing or incomplete documents render applications ineligible. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) You'll need a **passport or national ID** showing your photograph, date of birth, and country of citizenship. [Britishcouncil +2](https://study-uk.britishcouncil.org/scholarships-funding/commonwealth-scholarships) Academic documents include complete transcripts for all higher education qualifications with certified English translations if needed. [Fcdo +3](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/)

Reference requirements include **two academic references** submitted directly by referees through the online system, plus supporting statements from both your home supervisor and proposed Durham supervisor. [Fcdo +3](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) These supervisor statements are critical - they must be on institutional letterhead, signed, and explicitly detail the institutional partnership between universities. Without both statements confirming the institutional link, your application will be considered ineligible. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/)

Additional documents include your detailed research proposal, a four-part development impact statement, employment history if applicable, and up to 10 publications or prizes if relevant. While no specific English language test is required, all documents must be in English.

## Understanding your funding package

The scholarship provides comprehensive financial support for your 12-month UK stay. [Scholarshiproar](https://scholarshiproar.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2024/) **Monthly stipend rates for 2025/26** are £1,378 for most UK locations or £1,690 for London universities. [Fcdo +3](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) Based on Durham's location, you'll receive the standard rate, which adequately covers living costs in this historic city where accommodation ranges from £174-262 per week in university housing. [UniAcco](https://uniacco.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-durham)[Uhomes](https://en.uhomes.com/uk/durham)

**Full tuition fees** are covered through Durham's part-funding agreement with CSC - you pay nothing. [Scholarshiproar](https://scholarshiproar.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2024/)[Cranfield](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/funding/funding-opportunities/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships) The scholarship includes return economy airfare from your home country to the UK, [Greatyop](https://greatyop.com/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships/) a warm clothing allowance, and a study travel grant for research-related travel. [Fcdo +4](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) For widowed, divorced, or single parents only, limited child allowances are available: £590/month for the first child and £146/month for the second and third child under 16. [Opportunitydesk +2](https://opportunitydesk.org/2024/11/20/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/)

## Establishing crucial institutional links

The institutional link requirement is the most common reason for application rejection. Your universities must have a **formal partnership beyond individual researcher collaboration**. [Fcdo +2](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) Acceptable links include memoranda of understanding between institutions, departmental collaboration agreements, joint research projects, staff exchange programs, or established student mobility frameworks. [Opportunitiesforafricans](https://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/)[Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/)

Durham Physics has existing partnerships with several Commonwealth universities through various research networks. As the CoMPhy Lab, we maintain collaborations in computational materials science, quantum technology, and energy research. When approaching us, clearly indicate your home university's existing relationship with Durham or propose how such a partnership could be established.

Both supervisors must provide detailed statements explaining the nature of the institutional partnership, any history of collaboration, shared resources or facilities, and future partnership plans. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) These statements must demonstrate that the link exists at an organizational level, not just between individuals. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) Consider having your department head or international office confirm the partnership formally.

## Crafting a development-focused proposal

Your proposal must demonstrate clear development impact while maintaining scientific excellence. Durham's physics research aligns perfectly with several **CSC development themes**, particularly "Science and Technology for Development" [Greatyop](https://greatyop.com/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships/)[Scholarships Corner](https://scholarshipscorner.website/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships/) through our work in renewable energy, quantum applications, and computational methods for solving development challenges. [Britishcouncil +5](https://www.britishcouncil.in/study-uk/scholarships/commonwealth-scholarships)

Structure your development impact statement in four parts. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-shared-scholarships-applications/) First, **identify the problem** (200 words) by linking your research to global, national, and local development challenges. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-shared-scholarships-applications/) Use recent statistics from credible sources and connect to your chosen CSC theme. For physics research, this might involve energy access statistics, technology gaps, or infrastructure challenges in your home country.

Second, explain **skill application** (200 words) by detailing specific capabilities you'll gain at Durham and how you'll apply them post-award. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-shared-scholarships-applications/) Be specific about organizations you'll work with and implementation strategies. For CoMPhy research, this could include computational modeling skills, quantum technology expertise, or renewable energy system design.

Third, outline **expected outcomes** (200 words) with specific, measurable results over 1-5 years. Identify clear beneficiary groups and quantify impact where possible. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-shared-scholarships-applications/) For instance, improved solar cell efficiency could provide electricity to specific communities, or quantum sensing applications could enhance medical diagnostics in underserved areas.

Finally, describe **impact measurement** (100 words) including data collection methods, key performance indicators, and reporting mechanisms. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-shared-scholarships-applications/) Show how you'll track and demonstrate the real-world impact of your research.

## Meeting selection criteria for success

Selection panels evaluate applications using three equally weighted criteria, each accounting for 33% of your score. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/advice-for-applicants/) **Academic merit** assessment considers your degree classifications, research publications, and academic trajectory. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/advice-for-applicants/) While the minimum is a 2:1 degree, [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/)[Opportunitydesk](https://opportunitydesk.org/2024/11/20/commonwealth-split-site-phd-scholarships-2025-2026/) successful candidates often have first-class honours or distinction-level Master's degrees. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/advice-for-applicants/) Your referees should specifically address your intellectual capacity and research potential.

**Development impact** evaluation examines how clearly you articulate home country needs, the realism of your impact plans, and alignment with CSC themes. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/advice-for-applicants/) Successful applications demonstrate deep understanding of local contexts and propose achievable, measurable outcomes. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/advice-for-applicants/) Generic statements about "helping development" fail - be specific about who benefits and how. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/advice-for-applicants/)

**Research proposal quality** assessment focuses on scientific rigor, innovation, feasibility, and contribution to both knowledge and development. Your proposal should be accessible to non-specialist reviewers while maintaining scholarly standards. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/advice-for-applicants/) With success rates typically 5-10%, only the strongest applications combining all three elements succeed.

## Post-scholarship commitments and opportunities

Accepting this scholarship commits you to **return home within one month** of completion. CSC cannot support visa extensions, postdoctoral positions, or remaining for graduation ceremonies. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/)[Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/commonwealth-scholarships-frequently-asked-questions/) This return requirement ensures you apply your UK-gained knowledge for home country development.

You'll join a vibrant **lifelong alumni network** with immediate access to regional Commonwealth Scholar groups and ongoing engagement opportunities. [Britishcouncil](https://www.britishcouncil.in/study-uk/scholarships/commonwealth-scholarships)[Britishcouncil](https://study-uk.britishcouncil.org/scholarships-funding/commonwealth-scholarships) The Alumni Community Engagement Fund offers annual £1,200 grants for community development projects. [Fcdo](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/alumni-community-engagement-fund-applications-now-open-2/) You're expected to demonstrate ongoing development impact, mentor future applicants, and contribute to capacity building in your home institution.

Long-term obligations include participating in impact assessment surveys, sharing success stories, and maintaining active involvement in the Commonwealth Scholars community. This network provides invaluable connections across 54 Commonwealth countries and ongoing support for your development work.
