# Historical note on Worthington jets from bursting bubbles

## From Newtonian Beginnings to Viscoelastic Surprises (Historical Context)

Early studies of bubble bursting (dating back to at least the early 20th century) focused on Newtonian fluids and laid the groundwork for understanding the bursting mechanism. Pioneering experiments by A.M. Worthington over a century ago captured photographs of jets formed by collapsing cavities, essentially visualizing the birth of the Worthington jet phenomenon. By the mid-20th century, scientists recognized that bursting bubbles were important in nature ‚Äì for instance, generating sea spray aerosols and even transporting microorganisms. These studies assumed _ideal_ liquids like pure water, and by the late 1900s the physics was well-charted: when a bubble‚Äôs cap ruptures, a bowl-shaped cavity is left in the surface. Capillary waves travel down the cavity‚Äôs sides and converge at the cavity‚Äôs bottom, shooting a high-speed jet upward, which then often pinches off droplets. This Newtonian paradigm was the default for a long time.

However, real-world liquids aren‚Äôt always Newtonian. Sea water, for example, is full of **surfactants** and organic matter; foods and biofluids can be **viscoelastic** (think of saliva or mucus which stretches like a weak elastic goo). Researchers gradually realized that these non-Newtonian traits could change the bubble-bursting outcome. A key turning point came in the 1990s. In 1996, J.M. Cheny and K. Walters carried out experiments with water mixed with a tiny amount of polymer (on the order of only tens of parts per million). To everyone‚Äôs surprise, the addition of a **viscoelastic** agent (the polymer) dramatically altered the jet: even such a small polymer concentration reduced the jet height by roughly an order of magnitude. In other words, the normally tall, spire-like jet seen in pure water became stunted. This was a clear indication that something beyond ordinary viscosity ‚Äì namely elastic stresses introduced by the polymer ‚Äì was influencing the process. This historical milestone demonstrated that the classical Newtonian model was not the whole story, sparking fresh interest in bubble bursting under non-Newtonian conditions.

Over the following years, interest in _complex fluids_ grew, but only recently have we begun to see a flurry of studies examining bubble bursting in fluids with additives like polymers. The motivation is clear: **bubbles burst in nature and industry under all kinds of fluid conditions**, so understanding how phenomena like elasticity alter the outcome is crucial. Our current work fits into this evolving narrative by using simulations to dig deeper into those viscoelastic effects that intrigued researchers since the late 20th century.

## Viscoelastic Effects in Prior Studies: What Do We Know?

Several experimental and computational studies have set the stage for our current investigation by exploring how viscoelasticity changes the bursting-bubble dynamics. Building on the early findings of Cheny and Walters (1996), later researchers quantified and expanded those observations. Cheny and Walters had shown that introducing a small amount of polymer (roughly 50‚ÄØppm of a long-chain polymer in water) could drastically shrink the burst-induced jet. This **jet height suppression** implied that elastic stresses (even if the fluid had just a ‚Äúdash‚Äù of polymer) were counteracting the forces that typically drive a tall jet.

Fast-forward to recent years: Rodr√≠guez-D√≠az _et al._ (2023) carried out bubble-burst experiments with **weakly viscoelastic** polymer solutions and uncovered a nuanced effect. They observed that at an _optimal_ polymer concentration (around 25‚ÄØppm in their case), the tiny amount of polymer actually made the jet _faster_. How? The polymer molecules at the interface dampened the small ripples on the collapsing cavity (the short-wavelength capillary waves), leading to a smoother, more focused collapse. Smoothing out those ripples caused the liquid to shoot upward more directly, enhancing the jet‚Äôs velocity. In other words, a little elasticity at the interface ironed out disturbances that would normally waste energy, thus the jet came out quicker and slightly more forceful. However, when Rodr√≠guez-D√≠az _et al._ increased the polymer concentration further, the story changed. Higher polymer content introduced stronger **bulk elastic effects** ‚Äì essentially the liquid became noticeably stretchy or resistant to fast flow. In those cases, the rising jet often **failed to produce the usual top droplet at all**. The fluid‚Äôs elastic resistance to stretching (sometimes called **extensional thickening**) prevented the jet from necking and breaking up into a drop. In summary, their experiments showed a viscoelastic sweet spot where a little elasticity boosts the jet, and a regime where too much elasticity chokes off droplet formation.

Other studies have echoed these findings. Very recent work by Cabalgante-Corrales _et al._ (2025) further confirmed that beyond a certain elasticity threshold, **droplet emission can be completely suppressed**. In their observations, if the polymer relaxation time (a measure of how long the fluid‚Äôs elastic stresses persist) is sufficiently large compared to the timescale of the jet formation, no droplets are emitted at all ‚Äì the jet essentially forms a single column that retracts without snapping off a small drop. This threshold can be described in terms of a dimensionless **Weissenberg number** (which compares the polymer‚Äôs relaxation time to the jet‚Äôs characteristic time scale); when it exceeds a value on the order of 0.5, the fluid‚Äôs elasticity dominates the breakup process. All these prior studies, from 1996 to 2025, consistently point to the fact that even _weak_ viscoelasticity can profoundly influence the outcome of a bursting bubble. They provided clues like **droplet suppression** and **capillary-wave damping** that any complete theory or model must explain.

## How Our Simulations Build on These Insights

Our current study uses high-fidelity numerical simulations to explore bubble bursting in viscoelastic liquids, helping to clarify the mechanisms behind the experimental observations above. By employing an **Oldroyd-B viscoelastic model** (a common model for polymer solutions) in a Volume-of-Fluid simulation framework, we can control and vary the fluid‚Äôs key properties systematically ‚Äì something difficult to do in experiments. We map out a range of conditions in terms of dimensionless groups (like the _elasto-capillary number_ and _Deborah number_, which relate to polymer elasticity and relaxation time) to see how each influences the jet and droplet outcome. Essentially, these simulations let us rewind, pause, and inspect the bursting process in ways a high-speed camera cannot: we can look at the tension in the fluid, the distribution of polymer stresses, and test ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios by dialing elasticity up or down independently of other factors.

What we found corroborates many of the past experimental findings while also providing a clearer picture of why they happen. For instance, our simulations show that introducing a small amount of polymer indeed **dampens the high-frequency capillary waves** on the collapsing bubble cavity, much like Rodr√≠guez-D√≠az _et al._ noted. We can directly see the interface becoming smoother in the simulation, which in turn leads to a more coherent jet that can even travel faster than it would in pure water. On the other hand, when we crank up the viscoelastic effects (by increasing polymer concentration or elasticity in the simulation), the jet‚Äôs behavior changes dramatically. The jet tends to be thicker and more stable ‚Äì so stable, in fact, that it doesn‚Äôt break up into a droplet at the tip. This matches the **droplet suppression** regime reported in experiments. In the simulations, we observe that the polymer stresses accumulate during the cavity collapse and jet rise, and if those stresses are high enough, they counteract the necking that would normally pinch off a droplet. The result is a jet that simply subsides back without spraying droplets. By varying the fluid‚Äôs relaxation time, we can pinpoint the threshold at which this happens, supporting the idea that there is a critical viscoelastic relaxation timescale beyond which the droplet never forms.

In short, our simulations **extend the insights of earlier works** by providing a full-field view of the flow and isolating the roles of different effects. They confirm that the viscoelastic phenomena observed by Cheny & Walters, Rodr√≠guez-D√≠az _et al._, and others are not just experimental quirks, but fundamental aspects of the physics when polymers are present. Moreover, the simulations help untangle the interplay between viscous and elastic forces: for example, we find there‚Äôs a trade-off between a fluid‚Äôs viscosity and its elasticity in setting the jet speed and whether a droplet pinches off. This kind of systematic exploration would be challenging in a lab but is feasible in a simulation, allowing us to fill gaps in the understanding.

## Concluding Thoughts

Bubble bursting might last only a few milliseconds, but as research over the decades has shown, it‚Äôs a rich and complex phenomenon ‚Äì especially when you venture beyond ordinary liquids. Historically, scientists figured out the basics in simple fluids, establishing a baseline for how jets and droplets form after a burst. The addition of polymers and other non-Newtonian effects then revealed new twists: slower, stubbier jets or no droplets at all under the right conditions. By comparing past experiments and new simulations, we now have a much clearer picture of _why_ those twists occur. **Viscoelasticity**, in essence, adds a kind of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù to the liquid: the fluid remembers being stretched and fights back, which can either smooth out the jet formation or halt the droplet breakup ‚Äì or both.

For a scientifically curious reader or an early-career researcher, the take-home message is that **even a dash of polymer can tip the balance** of forces during a bubble burst. This means traditional Newtonian models need adjustments when dealing with real-world fluids. Our study contributes to this evolving understanding by not only confirming the experimental observations in a controlled setting but also by quantifying the thresholds and mechanisms at play. Going forward, these insights could inform everything from predicting oceanic spray in various water conditions to designing industrial processes (or even culinary tricks) where bubble bursting is a factor. The humble bubble, when combined with a bit of polymer physics, continues to teach us new fluid dynamics ‚Äì a beautiful example of how revisiting a classic problem with fresh eyes can lead to deeper knowledge.
