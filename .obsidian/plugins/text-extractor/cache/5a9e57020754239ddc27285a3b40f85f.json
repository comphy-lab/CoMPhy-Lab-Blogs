This talk will demonstrate howadding polymers modifies instabilities in three canonical free-surface flows:sheets punctured by holes (Taylor–Culick retraction), bursting bubbles that emitdroplets, and Worthington jets formed by impact. Elastic stresses either createnew singularities or suppress known ones, leading to distinct regimes inparameter space. Numerical simulations and complementary experiments reveal howpolymer relaxation time and modulus determine free-surface morphologies, dropletsizes, and jet velocities, with implications for aerosol generation and fluidprocessing. By unifying concepts from fluid and solid mechanics, these resultsprovide broad insight into controlling interfacial flows in manufacturing,pathogen transport, and beyond.How do polymeric flows influence classical hydrodyna ic singularities?SpeakerVatsal Sanjay (CoMPhy Lab)Metadata Posted by:: Vatsal Date published:: 2025-02-21Date modified:: Feb 21, 2025 at 07:23 CETBack to main websitethis page in .pdfHome, Team, Research, Github","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
