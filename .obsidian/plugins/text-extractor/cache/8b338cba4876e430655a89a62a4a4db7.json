{"path":"Talks/Seminar-Singularities 1.pdf","text":"Singularities in soft matter systemsSoft matter ﬂows frequently exhibit hydrodynamic singularities arising from the interplay of capillarity, inertia, viscosity, andelasticity. This talk explores such singularities across drops, bubbles, and thin ﬁlms, combining experiments, direct numericalsimulations, and theory. First, we investigate Worthington jets produced by drop impacts on superhydrophobic substrates, wherediscrete peaks in normal force mark singular events [1]. Next, we examine bursting bubbles in Newtonian and viscoelastic media,connecting elastic and viscous stresses to jet formation and droplet ejection [2]. Finally, for retracting liquid ﬁlms, wedemonstrate that classical Taylor–Culick dynamics harbours singular limits: a viscous anomaly in the Newtonian case and elasticstress blow-up in the viscoelastic regime [3]. By exploring this multidimensional phase space, we uncover new physical insightsinto these systems. The ﬁndings carry direct implications for manufacturing processes, droplet transport, and pathogen dispersalmitigation.SpeakerVatsal Sanjay (CoMPhy Lab)Metadata Posted by:: Vatsal Date published:: 2026-01-05Date modiﬁed:: 5 Jan 2026Back to main websiteHome, Team, Research, GithubᛟReferences[1] V.
