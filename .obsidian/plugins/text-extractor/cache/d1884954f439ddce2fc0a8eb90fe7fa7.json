Normalizing stresses with 𝛾/𝑅0, length with 𝑅0, and velocity with √𝛾/𝜌𝑙𝑅0… ̃𝜏 = 2[ 𝒥 2‖ ̃𝒟‖ + 𝜀 ℐ + 𝑂ℎ𝐾 (2‖ ̃𝒟‖ + 𝜖)𝑛−1] ̃𝒟. Here, the effective Ohnesorge is 𝑂ℎ𝐾 = 𝐾 √𝜌𝑛 𝑙 𝛾2−𝑛𝑅3𝑛−2 0 The plasto-capillary number 𝒥 is 𝒥 = 𝜏𝑦𝑅0 𝛾 One can easily see that putting 𝑛 = 1 recovers the Bingham model with 𝑂ℎ = 𝜂𝑙/√𝜌𝑙𝛾𝑅0. Additionally, with 𝑛 = 1 & 𝒥 = 0, the model will give a Newtonian response. More details on the implementation Calculate the norm of the deformation tensor 𝒟: 𝒟11 = 𝜕𝑢𝑟 𝜕𝑟 𝒟22 = 𝑢𝑟 𝑟 𝒟13 = 1 2 ( 𝜕𝑢𝑟 𝜕𝑧 + 𝜕𝑢𝑧 𝜕𝑟 ) 𝒟31 = 1 2 ( 𝜕𝑢𝑧 𝜕𝑟 + 𝜕𝑢𝑟 𝜕𝑧 ) 𝒟33 = 𝜕𝑢𝑧 𝜕𝑧 𝒟12 = 𝒟23 = 0. The second invariant is 𝒟2 = √𝒟𝑖𝑗𝒟𝑖𝑗 (this is the Frobenius norm) 𝒟 2 2 = 𝒟𝑖𝑗𝒟𝑖𝑗 = 𝒟11𝒟11 + 𝒟22𝒟22 + 𝒟13𝒟31 + 𝒟31𝒟13 + 𝒟33𝒟33 Note: ‖𝒟‖ = 𝐷2/√ 2. 1 We use the formulation as given in Balmforth et al. (2013) [1], who use the strain rate tensor ̇𝒮 which and its norm √ 1 2 ̇𝒮𝑖𝑗 ̇𝒮𝑖𝑗. Of course, given ̇𝒮𝑖𝑗 = 2𝐷𝑖𝑗. Calculate the equivalent viscosity Factorizing with 2𝒟𝑖𝑗 to obtain an equivalent viscosity 𝜂eff = 𝒥 2‖ ̃𝒟‖ + 𝜀 ℐ + 𝑂ℎ𝐾 (2‖ ̃𝒟‖ + 𝜖)𝑛−1 In this formulation, 𝜀 is a small number to ensure numerical stability. The term 𝜏𝑦 𝜀 + ... is equivalent to the 𝜇𝑚𝑎𝑥 of the previous (v1.0, see: GitHub) formulation [2]. Note: The fluid flows always, it is not a solid, but a very viscous fluid. Reproduced from: P.-Y. Lagrée’s Sandbox. Here, we use a face implementation of the regularisation method, described here.
