As the drop deforms and extends along cross stream direction while contracting in the streamwise direction there is unequal pressure distribution, Ap, around the drop. This process ends with gradual outward bulging of the oblate spheroidal structure which happens to accommodate the growing Ap across the drop. In this section we attempt to model the bag shape and establish its relationship with We and Oh. ‘Writing the following force balance at the bag tip and making We corrections to Ref. 9 by incorporating the surface tension term, we obtain &g 24 I /8-% T P2 VR o (25) Here, B = B(T) = %DQ, where «(T) is shown in Figs. 3 and 10. The initial conditions for this ) differential equation read as 8 (0) = 0 and B(0) = 0. The surface tension term involves evaluating the curvature term given by %, where r, varies with every point on the bag but since we are concerned with the dynamics near the bag tip this variation can be ignored. From geometrical considerations as shown in Fig. 10 we observe that the radius of curvature r, at the bag tip is RY(t) + ot = BO+a® @6) 2a(t) Using (27) in the force balance at the bag tip we obtain (26).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
