{"path":"Talks/Seminar-Durham-abstract.pdf","text":"Can polymeric flows be the Drosophila of continuum mechanics?Polymeric liquids provide a tunable testbed to explore unsteady, nonlinear continuum mechanics by systematically varying the amountand type of polymers. We explore how such systems can probe a continuum of behaviors from Newtonian flows to elastically dominat-ed regimes, making polymeric flows effectively the \"Drosophila\" of unsteady continuum mechanics. This talk will demonstrate howadding polymers modifies instabilities in three canonical free-surface flows: sheets punctured by holes (Taylorâ€“Culick retraction),bursting bubbles that emit droplets, and Worthington jets formed by impact. Elastic stresses either create new singularities or sup-press known ones, leading to distinct regimes in parameter space. Numerical simulations and complementary experiments reveal howpolymer relaxation time and modulus determine free-surface morphologies, droplet sizes, and jet velocities, with implications foraerosol generation and fluid processing. By unifying concepts from fluid and solid mechanics, these results provide broad insight intocontrolling interfacial flows in manufacturing, pathogen transport, and beyond.DetailsSpeaker:: Vatsal Sanjay (CoMPhy Lab)Seminar:: Durham UniversityWhen::Metadata Posted by:: VatsalDate published:: 2025-02-21Date modified:: Feb 21, 2025 at 07:23 CETBack to main websiteHome, Team, Research, Github","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
