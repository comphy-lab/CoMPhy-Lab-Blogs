Regime map in terms of the drop Ohnesorge number Ok and the impact Weber number We to summarize the two peaks in the impact force by showing the different regimes described in this work based on (a) the first peak in the impact force peak amplitude F; and () the second peak in the impact force peak amplitude F>. Both peaks are normalized by the inertial force scale F, = pdVgD%. These regime maps are constructed using ~ 1500 simulations in the range 0.001 < Ok < 100 and 1 < We < 1000. The grey solid line in (a) and dashed line in (b) mark the inertial-viscous transition (Re = 1) and the bouncing—no-bouncing transition (Oh, = 0.53 for Bo = 1, see Sanjay et al. (2023a)), respectively.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
