Schematic of asymmetric coalescence of bubbles. Following the coalescnece, train of capillary waves travel on the surface of both bubbles.

Trajectory of the capillary waves during coalescence of same unequal sized bubbles with 𝑅 ≫ 𝑟. Different colors represent different Ohnesorge numbers 𝑂ℎ. [!note] Infact the velocity hardly changes from 𝑅 = 𝑟 to 𝑅 ≫ 𝑟 Strength of capillary waves for 𝑅 = 𝑟 Although the speed of capillary waves remain the same. There can be differences in the strength of the waves. 3 Figure 4. The curvature of the strongest capillary wave decreases in time and then saturates to a constant value. This is different from what happens at 𝑅 ≫ 𝑟, 4 Figure 5. The curvature of the strongest capillary wave decreases in time, reaches a minima, and then increases sharply as the bubble cavity configuration changes (see video above, and also see [1]). Can we understand this change in curvature? Given the asymmetry at 𝑅 ≫ 𝑟, the waves have this feature to come back up and the curvature increases whereas for 𝑅 = 𝑟 symmetry of the problem results in no significant geometry change following flow focussing and the curvature does not further increase. Looking at the balance between the kinetic energy (generated immediately following the coalescence event), 𝑑 𝑑𝜏 ∫ Ω𝜅 𝜌𝑉 2 2 𝑑Ω𝜅 ∼ 2𝜂 ∫ Ω𝜂 (𝒟 ∶ 𝒟) 𝑑Ω𝜂 Note: Here, we balance the kinetic energy of the capillary waves (across volume Ω𝜅) with viscous dissipation across the bulk volume Ω𝜂 where velocity gradients are non-zero. Consequently, the volume scale associated with the kinetic energy carried by the waves is Ω𝜅 ∼ 𝑅𝜅−2 and the dissipation volume scales as Ω𝜂 ∼ 𝑅𝛿2 𝜂 where 𝛿𝜂 is the viscous boundary layer attached to the free-surface where velocity gradients are highest (see the videos above, the dark regions in visocus dissipation function characterize Ω𝜂 and high velocity regions indicate Ω𝜅) 5 1 𝜏 𝜌𝑉 2𝑅𝜅−2 ∼ 𝜂 ( 𝑉 𝜅−1 ) 2 𝑅𝛿2 Rearranging the above equation, we can find the time scale associated with this transfer process: 𝜏 ∼ 𝜌 𝜂 𝜅 −4 𝛿2 Rearranging the expression and substituting inertio-capillary timescale 𝜅4𝛿2 ∼ 𝜌 𝜂 √ 𝛾 𝜌𝑅3 Normalize both sides by 𝑅2, ̃𝜅 4 ̃𝛿2 ∼ √ 𝜌𝛾𝑅 𝜂 In the low viscosity limit, 𝛿 ∼ 𝜅−1, which giving ̃𝜅 ∼ 𝑂ℎ−1/2 In moderate high viscosity limit, 𝛿 ∼ √ 𝜂 𝜌 𝑡 = √ 𝜂 𝜌 ( 𝜌𝜅−3 𝛾 ) 1/2 Rearranging the expression and filling in the general equation relating 𝜅 and 𝛿 gives ̃𝜅 5/2 ∼ 𝜌𝛾𝑅 𝜂2 or, ̃𝜅 ∼ 𝑂ℎ−4/5 6 Figure 6. Minumum curvature of the strongest capillary wave as a function of the Ohnesorge number and the radii ratio of the two bubbles. The two scaling relations developed above are reasonable but the deviations observed in the data leave room for improvement. So, why does the radii ratio influence the curvature strongly but not the wave speed? Unfortunately, this is still an open question. The hand-wavy argument is given in this document (including the geometric and asymmetry arguments) but the scaling laws developed here only work approximately and clearly the data for 𝑂ℎ → 0 shows deviation in curvature. #foodForThought More resources GitHub License Latest Changes .pdf [1] V.
