For clean interfaces this bridge expansion issymmetric, but the outcome can ﬂip when one drop carries surfactant and the other is clean: rather than merging, one drop can pushthe other aside. This matters because coalescence outcomes directly control pattern ﬁdelity in inkjet printing, mixing eﬃciency inmicroﬂuidic handling, and emulsion stability, yet the earliest surfactant-mediated dynamics at ﬁrst contact remain poorly characterised.This talk shows how insoluble surfactants modify this earliest stage in an asymmetric conﬁguration where one sessile drop is initiallycoated (concentration Γ0) and the other is clean. Using a long-wave lubrication model coupled to surfactant transport, together withasymptotic analysis and high-resolution simulations, we map regimes in surfactant strength β, surface Peclet number Pe (interfacialadvection relative to surface diﬀusion), and contact angle θ. In the rapid-diﬀusion limit (Pe→0), surfactant quickly homogenisesnear the neck, so the bridge height follows the clean-drop similarity with renormalised capillary driving, h0≃0.272(1−βΓ0/2)θ4t,while transient Marangoni stresses break symmetry and drive a drift x0∝t3/2 with a diﬀusion-controlled maximum excursionxf∼βPe. In the slow-diﬀusion limit (Pe→∞), surfactant remains sharply segregated and sharp fronts develop; the dynamics areorganised by a critical strength βc≈0.15: above βc, Marangoni stresses suppress vertical bridge growth and sustain a translating,weakly coalescent state, whereas below βc drift arrests via vorticity generation. In the purely advective limit, the surfactant ﬁelddevelops Burgers-type kinematic shocks. Overall, these results provide a regime map for surfactant-mediated sessile-drop coalescence atﬁrst contact.AuthorsJnandeep Talukdar, Duarte Rocha, Christian Diddens, Jacco Snoeijer, Detlef Lohse, and Vatsal Sanjay*\n\n","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
