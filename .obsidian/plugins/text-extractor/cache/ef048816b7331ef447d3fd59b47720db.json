M. Burgers Centre for Fluid Dynamics, University of Twente, 7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands (Received 1 May 2004; revised manuscript received 30 August 2004; published 3 November 2004) Very ﬁne sand is prepared in a well-deﬁned and fully decompactiﬁed state by letting gas bubble through it. After turning off the gas stream, a steel ball is dropped on the sand. On impact of the ball, sand is blown away in all directions (‘‘splash’’) and an impact crater forms. When this cavity collapses, a granular jet emerges and is driven straight into the air. A second jet goes downwards into the air bubble entrained during the process, thus pushing surface material deep into the ground. The air bubble rises slowly towards the surface, causing a granular eruption. In addition to the experiments and the discrete particle simulations we present a simple continuum theory to account for the void collapse leading to the formation of the upward and downward jets. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.198003 PACS numbers: 45.70.–n, 96.20.Ka, 96.35.Gt According to Shoemaker, the ‘‘impact of solid bodies is the most fundamental process that has taken place on the terrestrial planets’’ [1], as they shape the surfaces of all solar system bodies. A lot of information on this process has been extracted from remote observations of impact craters on planetary surfaces. However, the nature of the geophysical impact events is that they are nonreproduci- ble. Moreover, their scale is enormous and direct obser- vations are not possible. On the other hand, Thoroddsen and Shen did small scale experiments by letting a lead sphere fall on monodisperse spherical glass beads [2]. They found a jet emerging from the impact site. Similar jets are long known when a ball or a ﬂuid droplet impacts on a liquid surface [3–7]. We did similar experiments as in [2], but now on extremely ﬁne sand (average grain size of about 40 \u0001m; grains are nonspherical) [8]. We found it hard to achieve quantitatively reproducible results, pre- sumably due to the random nature of the force-chain networks in the granular material [9–12]. Therefore, in order to prepare a well-deﬁned initial state, we decom- pactify and homogenize the ﬁne sand by blowing air through it via a perforated bottom plate. The height of the sand bed above the bottom plate is typically 25– 40 cm. The air is slowly turned off before the experiments and the grains are left to settle in an extremely loose packing (41% volume fraction) with the force chains either broken or substantially weakened. We call this a ‘‘ﬂuidlike’’ state. Impact events on this well-prepared ﬁne sand will be gravity dominated. We let a steel ball (radius R0 \u0001 1:25 cm) fall from various heights (up to 1.5 m) onto the sand and observe the dynamics of the sand with a digital high-speed camera (up to 2000 frames per second). The series of visible events is as follows (see Fig. 1): First, the ball vanishes in the sand and a crownlike splash is created. Inhomogeneities develop in the crown, due to the inelastic particle-particle interaction (Fig. 1, frames 3–5). Then, after a while, a jet shoots out of the sand at the position of impact. In all our experiments the jet height exceeds the release height of the ball; see Fig. 2(a). While the upper part of the jet is still going upwards, in the lower parts the inelastic particle-particle collisions lead to density inhomogeneities in the jet FIG. 1. Jet formation after the impact (v0 \u0001 2:43 m=s)of a steel ball of R0 \u0001 1:25 cm on loose very ﬁne sand. The jet in this experiment exceeds the release height of the ball. Frames 2– 4: splash; frames 5–6: a jet emerges; frame 7: clustering within the jet; frames 8–9: granular eruption at the surface.

These inhomogeneities resemble those of the surface tension driven Rayleigh instability of a water jet, even though there is no surface tension in granular matter. Finally, after about half a second, a granular eruption is seen at the position of impact, re- sembling a volcano (Fig. 1, frames 8–9). The collapsing jet ﬁrst leaves a central peak in the crater [13–15], but the granular eruption violently erases this peak. How does the jet form? To ﬁnd out what is going on below the surface of the sand, we (i) performed direct numerical simulations, (ii) redid the experiments in two dimensions, meaning that we replaced the ball by a cyl- inder (with the axis parallel to the surface and orthogonal to the side plates) which we let fall into a bed of sand between two transparent plates, and (iii) employed the analogy to jet formation in ﬂuids [3–7,16]. (i) In the discrete particle simulations, the sand parti- cles are modeled as spheres which interact via inelastic ‘‘soft-sphere’’ collision rules. The interaction of the par- ticles with the surrounding air is included via empirical drag force relations [17]. Since the maximum number of particles that can be simulated is presently of the order of 106, we can perform only quasi-two-dimensional simu- lations, where the thickness of the sand bed between the parallel plates is eight grains [18]. Altogether, the calcu- lation includes N \u0001 1:3 \u0002 106 homogeneous beads of density 1000 kg=m3 and diameter 500 \u0001m (i.e., approxi- mately a factor of 10 larger than in experiment) in a container of 24 \u0002 0:4cm2 ground area and a sand bed height of about 17 cm. The beads are preﬂuidized with air, just as in the experiments, and then a 1.5 cm diameter ball of density 3500 kg=m3 is dropped onto the beads with an impact velocity of 2m=s. The series of events can be seen in Fig. 3, revealing the jet formation process invisible in Fig. 1: The impacting ball creates a void which is then pressed together through the ‘‘hydrostatic’’ pressure from the side which nonlinearly increases with depth [19]. At small depth the ball passes early, meaning an early start of the void collapse, which however is weak due to the small hydrostatic pressure. Conversely, at larger depth the collapse of the void begins later but is stronger due to the larger hydrostatic pressure. Somewhere in the middle the collapse is ﬁnished ﬁrst, and the void walls hit each other. It is this singularity which leads to the formation of two jets: One upwards and one downwards into an air bubble which was entrained in the sand by the void collapse. The falling jet often leaves a central peak in the crater (which in our 3D experiments with the ﬁne, decompactiﬁed sand is subsequently erased again by the granular eruption). Note that the jet in the discrete particle simulations is much less pronounced than in experiment. First, because the beads in the simulations are much larger than the sand grains in the experiment; i.e., the sand bed is less ﬂuidlike and allows for less ﬁne structure. Second, the singularity due to the focusing along the axis of symmetry is weaker in 2D and quasi-2D experiments or simulations than in 3D, and the jet takes the form of a sheet. We will present a quantitative comparison of experimental and numerical impact events on 500 \u0001m beads elsewhere. (ii) We performed such 2D jet formation experiments by letting a cylinder fall into decompactiﬁed sand be- tween two transparent plates and observing the jet for- mation process from the side [8]. These experiments FIG. 2 (color online). (a) Jet height as a function of release height of the ball in our experiments (solid bullets with error bars) and in those of Ref. [2] [for spheres in a granulate of a different diameter: ds \u0001 0:08 mm (pluses), ds \u0001 0:118 mm (triangles), ds \u0001 0:176 mm (solid squares)]. The jets of Ref. [2] never reach the release height, because the granulate is less ﬁne and much less decompactiﬁed. In our experiments jets are produced even at zero impact height [21] and there is no scaling relation as in Ref. [2]. (b) Sketch of the void collapse. When the accelerated sand grains from the sidewalls of the cylindrical cavity collide on the axis of the cavity, two jets are formed: one downward into the entrained air bubble formed above the sphere, and one upward straight into the air.

Again, the jet is less pronounced than in the 3D experiments. The en- trained air bubble slowly rises in these experiments, ﬁnally leading to a granular eruption at the surface, just as observed in 3D. (iii) The same series of events is also found after an analogous impact of a steel ball or a falling disk on water [3–7,16,20]. We employ this analogy in order to set up a ‘‘minimal’’ continuum mechanical model, in order to work out the essentials of the void collapse. First, the delay curve z\u0003t\u0004 of the ball in the sand can be obtained from a simple force balance model involving drag, gravity, and added mass. It describes the experi- mental results obtained for a falling ball equipped with a thin stiff tail, which allows for easy depth measurements [21]. The delay curve z\u0003t\u0004 of the ball is inverted to obtain tpass\u0003z\u0004, the time when the ball passes the layer of sand at depth z. This sets the initial conditions for the two- dimensional collapse of the void at this depth, namely, R\u0003z; tpass\u0004\u0001 R0 and _R\u0003z; tpass\u0004\u0001 0. Here, R\u0003z; t\u0004 is the time and depth dependent radius of the void; see Fig. 2(b). Next, the collapse of the void formed by the ball has to be described. It is driven by the (hydrostatic) sand pres- sure p\u0003z\u0004 at depth z. For small z the pressure simply is p\u0003z\u0004\u0001 \rsgz; for larger z it saturates [19]. Here, \rs is the sand density, assumed to be constant. If we neglect the dissipative processes both between the different layers of sand and between the sand grains in one layer, the dy- namics for ﬁxed depth z is determined by the Euler equation, \rs\u0005@tv\u0003r; t\u0004\u0006 v\u0003r; t\u0004@rv\u0003r; t\u0004\u0007 \u0001 \b@rp\u0003r; t\u0004: (1) Here, v\u0003r; t\u0004 is the velocity ﬁeld in the sand. With con- tinuity @r\u0005rv\u0003r; t\u0004\u0007 \u0001 0, and with the boundary conditions v\u0001R\u0003t\u0004;t\u0002 \u0001 _R\u0003t\u0004 at the void’s wall and v\u0003R1;t\u0004\u0001 0 far away from the void, one obtains a Rayleigh-type [22,23] ordinary differential equation for each R\u0003z; t\u0004, namely, \u0003R \u0012R \u0006 _R2\u0004 log R R1 \u0006 1 2 _R2 \u0001 1 \rs p\u0003z\u0004\u0001 gz: (2) The radius R1 is of the order of the system size, but the results only weakly (logarithmically) depend on this parameter. The dynamics following from this Rayleigh- type model is shown in Fig. 4, resembling the void collapse in the discrete particle simulations (Fig. 3), in the 2D experiments [8], in experimental work on the void collapse in transparent ﬂuids [3–7,16], in boundary inte- gral simulations of the complete hydrodynamical equa- tions [20], and therefore presumably also in the 3D experiments in sand shown in Fig. 1. Just before and at the singularity [R\u0003t\u0004\u0001 0 and diverging velocity], the dynamics is determined by R \u0012R \u0006 _R2 \u0001 0, which has the solution R\u0003t\u0004 \u0003ts \b t\u0004 1=2, where ts is the time of the singularity. The velocity therefore has a square-root di- vergence _R\u0003t\u0004 \u0003ts \b t\u0004 \b1=2. Having shown that the void collapse is driven by hydro- static pressure, we now can deduce scaling arguments [24] for the limiting case of large impact velocity v0, which is the relevant one in the geophysical context. The time up to void collapse in depth z is the sum of the time z=v0 it takes the ball to get there and the collapse time itself, which scales as R0= \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001 gz p . The depth zc where the walls of the void ﬁrst touch (i.e., the position of the singularity) can be obtained from minimizing this sum with respect to z, resulting in zc=R0 Fr 1=3, where Fr \u0001 v2 0=\u0003gR0\u0004 is the Froude number. From this one obtains that the time of the collapse tc scales as tc \u0003R0=v0\u0004Fr 1=3 \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001 R0=g p Fr\b1=6 [24]. For large v0 these scaling laws are consistent both with our continuum model and with our discrete particle simulations. We now discuss the role of the ambient air and the ambient pressure for the evolution of the jet: (i) For (3D) experiments with very high impact velocities we ob- served that after the splash the crown goes inwards rather than outwards, due to the pressure reduction behind the fast projectile (Bernoulli’s law). The crown, in fact, can fully close and the jet then hits the closed crown, leading to an explosionlike collision which spreads material all over the place. (ii) In impact experiments on very ﬁne and loose sand but with strongly reduced ambient pressure the jet, in fact, is less pronounced than with ambient pressure [25]. For larger particles (500 \u0001m) we redid above dis- crete particle simulations, but now reduced the air pres- sure to zero (vacuum) after ﬂuidization. This gives very similar results for the jet formation. More research on the role of air in loose ﬁne granular material clearly is required. We conclude the Letter with speculations on possible implications of our ﬁndings on the impact mechanism FIG. 4 (color online). A cross section of the 3D-void collapse following from our Rayleigh-type model, for the same impact velocity and ball radius as in Fig. 1. The void is pressed together by the hydrostatic pressure from the side, leading to a singu- larity and an upward and downward jet. VOLUME 93, NUMBER 19 P H Y S I C AL R E V I E W L E TTE R S week ending 5 NOVEMBER 2004 198003-3 198003-3 within the geophysical context [14,26 –30]. In general, impacts can be described using two dimensionless pa- rameters: the Froude number Fr \u0001 V2=gR and the (in- verse) Newton number Nt\b1 \u0001 \rV2=Y, where \r, V,and R are the density, velocity, and radius of the impactor, respectively, and Y is the yield stress of the target [30]. Although the absolute energy scales in our experiment are of course very different as compared to geophysical events, the relative scales are comparable: very large- scale planetary impacts (Y \f 10 kbar, R \f 100 km,and V \f 10 km=s) and our experiments (Y \f 10 Pa, R \f 1cm,and V \f 3m=s) both lead to Froude and Newton numbers of the same order: Fr \f 102 and Nt\b1 \f 103. At this point we caution the reader to directly translate or upscale the results of our laboratory experiments to the geophysical scales as, in addition to the aforementioned difference in absolute energy scales, lack of reproducibil- ity of the details typify geophysical events. Nonetheless, we believe that the following speculations may stimulate discussions in a geophysical context: (i) After the impact of a solid body on a planet, it may be the upward jet and not the splash which is the dominant source of planetary material transferred into space [28]. Similarly, an oblique jet resulting from an oblique impact (not shown here; in that case the jet goes backwards) allows for an enhanced backwards transport of material, as compared to the splash. (ii) The collapsing jet may contribute to the cen- tral peak often found in impact craters [14,15]. (iii) The downward jet will considerably change the layering of the sediments underneath a crater, as it provides a mechanism how surface material can be transported deep into the ground. In addition, a granular eruption will rearrange the sediment. Our suggested mechanism may shed new light on the sediment layering data found underneath the Chicxulub crater, which is a source of major controversy [31–34]. We thank H. J. Melosh and J. Smit for discussions. The work is part of the research program of FOM, which is ﬁnancially supported by NWO, and R. B., R. M., C. Z., D. v. d. M., and M.V. acknowledge ﬁnancial support. [1] E. M.
