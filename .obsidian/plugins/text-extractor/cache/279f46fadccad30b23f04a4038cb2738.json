This talk exploressuch singularities across drops, bubbles, and thin films, combining experiments,direct numerical simulations, and theory. First, we investigate Worthington jetsproduced by drop impacts on superhydrophobic substrates, where discrete peaks innormal force mark singular events [1]. Next, we examine bursting bubbles inNewtonian and viscoelastic media, connecting elastic and viscous stresses to jetformation and droplet ejection [2]. Finally, for retracting liquid films, wedemonstrate that classical Taylor–Culick dynamics harbours singular limits: aviscous anomaly in the Newtonian case and elastic stress blow-up in theviscoelastic regime [3]. By exploring this multidimensional phase space, weuncover new physical insights into these systems. The findings carry directimplications for manufacturing processes, droplet transport, and pathogendispersal mitigation.SpeakerVatsal Sanjay (CoMPhy Lab)Metadata Posted by:: Vatsal Date published:: 2026-01-05Date modified:: Jan 5, 2026Back to main websiteHome, Team, Research, GithubᛟReferences[1] V.
