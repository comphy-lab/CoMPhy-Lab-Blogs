Figure 9 shows the comparison between theory and experiment using the non-dimensional velocity U (T) at r = R for Oh = 0.002. Good agreement between the two is seen. Another relevant parameter in the atomization context that we can extract from (23) is T;;, the initiation time. Using (23) we compute the initiation time for inviscid drops as written below Bl Tt = M‘ (24) 224 i We","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
