{"path":"_Media/review.pdf","text":"Comments on “State-and-rate friction in contact-line dynamics” The article discusses the dynamics of the contact-line motion of sessile drops deposited and aspirated from horizontal surfaces. The study measures the contact angle and drop width simultaneously during droplet removal to determine the changes in the shape of the drop as it depins and recedes. The data suggests that there is a force that opposes the motion of the contact line that depends on the time the drop has been in contact with the surface and the withdrawal rate. An overdamped dynamical model of contact-line motion is used to capture the experimentally observed behavior for water on the silanized glass, where the phenomenological drag coefficient and the assumed equilibrium contact angle are the only inputs. For other liquid/substrate pairs, the observed contact-line motion suggests that a maximum static friction force and damping are also essential. The dependence on time of contact and withdrawal rate is qualitatively consistent across three substrate-liquid pairs, reminiscent of rate-and-state friction between solid surfaces. There are a few interesting observations in the paper. Unfortunately, the explanations for the same need further clarification and details (see below). The current work is already superb, and I would like to thank the authors for such a thought-provoking undertaking. Naturally, I have several questions and comments. I recommend publication in Phys. Rev. E, once these questions are answered. Phenomenological fitting parameters in the model I would like to better understand the different phenomenological fitting parameters in the model. 1. θeq: How does this angle relate to Young-Dupr´e’s contact angle? The first equation of the paper suggests that they are the same. However, it needs to be clarified. If they are the same, why is it a fitting parameter? Why is it not known as apriori? The Invariance of θeq with τ and q and its dependence on the type of system (fig. 9 of the manuscript) further suggests that this is a constant material independent of flow parameters. Is that so? 2. β: Can the authors suggest better quantifying this parameter? For now, it seems to be an ad-hoc fitting parameter. However, does it have any physical (perhaps microscopic) significance? Experimental method In the experimental protocol, a drop is deposited on a substrate and then aspirated after waiting for a time τ . During this time, the drop has a constant volume (ignoring any mass loss due to evaporation). With this continuous volume, before any liquid is pumped out, the drop will relax to its equilibrium contact angle (θeq) given by Young-Dupr´e’s relation. This is evident from figure 2 of the manuscript where longer τ results in θ0 closer to θeq. Is the above inference correct? It will be nice to have this discussion somewhere in the manuscript. Indeed, perhaps the most significant influence of τ seems to be on the initial condition. However, the same figure also suggests that w is smaller with increasing τ . Although, this decrease is minimal, and the difference in initial conditions might be due to different initial volumes of the drop. Furthermore, the constant volume relaxation of the drop to its equilibrium contact angle (θeq) would imply an increase in the initial width (w0) due to a slow (Tanner-like) spreading law which is contrary to figure 2. Numerical solution of the model equation The solution methodology of the model equation only becomes apparent in the appendix on page 9. If I understand correctly, the steps are: 1. At any given time, find the volume of the drop using the relation: V (t) = V0 − qt, where V0 is the initial volume of the drop, and q is the volume flow rate measured by fitting for the slope of the experimental volume vs. time data. 10 2 4 6 8 10 t 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8V V (t) 0 2 4 6 8 10 t 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5WFull equation.

The volume flow rate is q = 0.08. The Young-Dupr´e’s equilibrium angle is θeq = 50 ◦. 2. Using the width from the previous time step, the contact angle θ is calculated using one or the other equation for the volume of a spherical cap, V = π 3 ( w sin θ )3 (2 + cos θ) (1 − cos θ) 2 . (1) There are several ways it can be done. Perhaps, it would be nice for readers to know exactly how this was done. While attempting to reproduce the results of this work, I have attached a Jupyter notebook with more details. 3. Once θ is known, if it is smaller than the equilibrium contact angle θeq, the contact line moves inwards following the relation: v = dw dt = − 2γLG β (cos θ − cos θeq). At least the information that the contact line is allowed to move only when the force (given by γLG (cos θ − cos θeq)) is positive should be included in the main text. Perhaps, the model equation can be rewritten as: v = dw dt = { 0 ∀ θ > θeq − 2γLG β (cos θ − cos θeq) ∀ θ < θeq (2) The motivation for allowing the contact line to move only when the force (given by γLG (cos θ − cos θeq)) is positive is also unclear. Is this a phenomenological observation? Perhaps, the static and kinetic friction analogy could be employed here to rationalize this assumption. Note that this assumption contributes majorly to the final model. The θeq value determines the plateau’s extent in w − θ plots. By the way, modifying the original experiments to remove the effect of pinning at the drop’s initial contact line is ingenious and very informative. In fact, thanks to this method, the authors have been able also to study the cases where the initial contact angle (θ0 ) is smaller than the equilibrium contact angle. In such cases, the drop contact angle increases (to approach θeq). For all other cases considered in the present manuscript, the initial angle θ0 is higher than the equilibrium contact angle θeq. This advantage could be further highlighted. Comparison to other theories My biggest criticism of the present model is the need for more comparison to previously proposed models. I agree that the formulation of the current model is very different from the ones in the literature, as rightly pointed out by the authors. Nonetheless, a preliminary analysis shows that the other models perform as well as the one proposed in the present manuscript. Please refer to the Jupyter notebook attached to this referee report. First, the present model can be rewritten as: v = dw dt = { 0 ∀ θ > θeq − 1 M1 (cos θ − cos θeq) ∀ θ < θeq (3) where M1 can be thought of some sort of contact line mobility. One can further simplify equation 3 using Taylor expansion for cos θ = 1 − θ2/2, giving v = dw dt = { 0 ∀ θ > θeq − 1 M2 (θ2 eq − θ2) ∀ θ < θeq (4) 20 2 4 6 8 10 t 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0V V (t) 0 2 4 6 8 10 t 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0WFull equation.

The Young-Dupr´e’s equilibrium angle is θeq = 60 ◦. Notice the variation in contact line mobility Mi used to fit the four models between here and figure 2. Yet another (and often misused) model is the Cox-Voinov (Cox, 1986; Voinov, 1976). A very naive and simplistic implementation might read v = dw dt = { 0 ∀ θ > θeq − 1 M3 (θ3 eq − θ3) ∀ θ < θeq (5) Please note that a more complicated function of θ can be used following the works of Afkhami et al. (2018), Chan et al. (2020), Snoeijer (2006), and Snoeijer and Andreotti (n.d.). Lastly, one of the least appreciated contact line models was proposed by Davis (1980). Recent works from Bostwick and Steen (2013a,b), Kern et al. (2021, 2022), and McCraney et al. (2022) have used this model with great success. v = dw dt = { 0 ∀ θ > θeq − 1 M4 (θeq − θ) ∀ θ < θeq (6) To further add to the success of this model, Ludwicki et al. (2022) have recently proposed that the mobility M4 is indeed a material parameter. For details of the calculations, please refer to the Jupyter notebook attached to this review. Figures 1, 2, and 3 summarize the results from this comparison. Clearly, tuning the values of different fitting parameters M1, M2, M3, and M4, all four models provide similar results. Of course, the simplified form of Cox-Voinov (equation 5) is not physical if one realizes that the capillary number in the present work is very small ≤ 10−4 as an order one mobility M3 = 9Ca log (r/λ) is needed to fit realistic observations. Lastly, I strongly suggest the authors add temporal variations as well. For example, how does the width of the droplet and its contact angle θ change with time? Adding the source codes to reproduce the results presented in this work is also highly recommended.
