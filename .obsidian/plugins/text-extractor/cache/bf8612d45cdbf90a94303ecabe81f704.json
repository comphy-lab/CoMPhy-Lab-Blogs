The primary focus is to address periodic standing waves and Stokes waves, which are critical for understanding wave interactions in shallow and deep water regimes. Central to this is determining coeﬀicients and analytical solutions for arbitrary-order expansions. Methodology • [[fentonNumericalMethodsNonlinear1999|Fenton (1999)]] emphasizes numerical solutions for nonlinear problems, including high-order Fourier methods for wave field expansions and their convergence prop- erties. [1] • [[fentonNonlinearWaveTheories1990|Fenton (1990)]] extends nonlinear wave theories with cnoidal and Stokes theories to fifth-order expansions, using Fourier techniques for enhanced computational accuracy. [2] Both employ polynomial and trigonometric expansions for solving boundary conditions and streamline the application of nonlinear theories in various wave contexts. Key Findings 1. Equation of Arbitrary Order Standing Waves: The governing expressions for surface elevation and velocity components leverage Fourier series expansions or hyperbolic functions, depending on the wave height and wavelength regime: • Standing wave elevation, ￿(x, t), approximates multiple harmonics where coeﬀicients stem from iterative numerical techniques. • Stokes coeﬀicients for arbitrary-order expansions use factorial-based formulas for precise amplitude corrections. 2. Numerical Accuracy: • Both methods demonstrate high accuracy when wave heights and wavelengths align with their regimes of validity, but overlap regions where neither theory performs optimally exist. • The fifth-order Stokes expansion offers excellent performance for waves with moderate wavelengths, while cnoidal approximations excel for shallow water waves. Implications The work advances computational methods to extend the precision of nonlinear wave predictions, enabling: - Safer and more cost-effective coastal structure designs. - Improved models for wave propagation over complex seabeds. Recommendations One option is to use mixed-order Stokes-cnoidal expansions for transitional regimes and refine computa- tional methods for boundary conditions in breaking wave scenarios. Conclusion Both approaches present robust solutions for their respective regimes but highlight the need for further refinement in transitional wavelength-depth conditions. Key Takeaways • ￿ Stokes Theory Excellence: Best for deep water waves where wavelength-depth ratios are small. • ￿ Cnoidal Theory for Shallow Water: Ideal for long waves with large wavelength-depth ratios. 2 • ￿ Overlap Regions: Transitional wave conditions (e.g., intermediate wavelength-depth ratios) chal- lenge accuracy for both theories. • ￿ Numerical Methods’ Power: Fourier approximations enhance precision across nonlinear wave calculations. • ￿ Wave Breaking Limits: Experiments suggest practical wave heights rarely approach theoretical maxima. • ￿ ￿ Streamline Accuracy: Velocity and pressure fields computed with Stokes and cnoidal methods align closely with Fourier-derived benchmarks. One-line summary: High-order Stokes and cnoidal theories provide accurate tools for nonlinear wave modeling, but computational refinements remain necessary for transitional regimes. Additional Details Arbitrary Order Standing Wave Equation A general formula for Stokes coeﬀicients of the (n)-th order wave, as described in the texts, resembles: double stokes_coefficient(int n) { if (n == 1) return 1.0; double double_factorial = 1.0; for (int i = 1; i <= 2*n - 1; i += 2) double_factorial *= i; return double_factorial / (pow(2, n - 1) * tgamma(n + 1)); } And for the surface elevation of Stokes waves: double eta_stokes(double x, double a, double k, int order) { double eta = 0.0; double epsilon = k * a; for (int n = 1; n <= order; n++) { double c = stokes_coefficient(n); eta += c * pow(epsilon, n) * cos(n * k * x); } return eta * a; } These computations involve harmonic terms, with coeﬀicients determined iteratively or analytically, ensuring convergence and numerical stability.
