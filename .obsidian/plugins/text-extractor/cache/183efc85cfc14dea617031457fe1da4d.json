Resolving the Dupré–Rayleigh paradox through proper energy accounting and momentum conservation. This lecture bridges Lecture 1’s introduction to the paradox with a complete resolution. Introduction: The Unresolved Paradox In Lecture 1, we encountered a puzzle: when you puncture a soap bubble, the film edge retracts inward with remarkable speed. Yet two seemingly correct physical approaches gave different predictions for this retraction velocity: Dupré–Rayleigh (Energy): 𝑣 = √ 4𝛾𝑓𝑎 𝜌ℎ0 (disagreed with experiment) Taylor–Culick (Momentum): 𝑣 = √ 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 𝜌ℎ0 (agreed with experiment) Question: If momentum conservation gives the right answer, why did energy conservation fail? Where did the missing energy go? This lecture resolves this paradox, which was finally answered convincingly by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes in 1996—more than a century after Rayleigh’s original observations. 1 Historical Context: A Long-Standing Mystery Rayleigh’s Pioneering Work (1891) John William Strutt, 2nd Baron Rayleigh, used instantaneous photography to capture the dynamics of liquid jets and interfaces. In a remarkable 1891 paper, he observed breaking jets and proposed an energy-balance argument for the speed of film retraction: Rate of surface energy decrease = Rate of kinetic energy increase Mathematically: 𝑑 𝑑𝑡 ( 1 2 𝑚𝑣2) = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎(2𝜋𝑅)𝑣 This yielded: 𝑣Dupre-Rayleigh = √ 4𝛾𝑓𝑎 𝜌ℎ0 A Curious Anomaly Despite its elegant derivation, Rayleigh’s prediction was faster than observed—a factor of √ 2 too fast. For nearly 70 years, this discrepancy puzzled the fluid mechanics community. 2 The Three Perspectives: Energy, Momentum, and Dissipation 1. The Energy Perspective (Dupré & Rayleigh, 1891) The energy balance assumes that all surface energy released goes into kinetic energy of the retracting film: Setup: A circular film of radius 𝑅, thickness ℎ0, with surface energy per interface 𝛾𝑓𝑎. Surface energy in the film: 𝐸𝑠 = 2 ⋅ 𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ (area) = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ 2𝜋𝑅ℎ0 Rate of energy decrease: − 𝑑𝐸𝑠 𝑑𝑡 = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ 2𝜋 𝑑𝑅 𝑑𝑡 ⋅ ℎ0 = −2𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ 2𝜋ℎ0𝑣𝑓 (Negative because 𝑑𝑅 𝑑𝑡 = −𝑣𝑓 as radius shrinks) Kinetic energy of moving film: 𝐸𝑘 = 1 2 𝑚𝑣2 𝑓 = 1 2 𝜌𝑉 𝑣2 𝑓 = 1 2 𝜌(2𝜋𝑅ℎ0)𝑣2 𝑓 Energy conservation: 𝑑𝐸𝑘 𝑑𝑡 = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ 2𝜋ℎ0𝑣𝑓 𝑑 𝑑𝑡 [ 1 2 𝜌(2𝜋𝑅ℎ0)𝑣2 𝑓 ] = 4𝜋𝛾𝑓𝑎ℎ0𝑣𝑓 Assuming constant velocity 𝑣𝑓 (steady-state retraction): 1 2 𝜌 ⋅ 2𝜋ℎ0 ⋅ (2𝑣𝑓 ⋅ 𝑣𝑓 ) + 𝜌2𝜋ℎ0𝑣𝑓 ⋅ 𝑣𝑓 = 4𝜋𝛾𝑓𝑎ℎ0𝑣𝑓 3 Wait—this is subtle. Let me reconsider carefully. The mass of the rim changes as material flows into it from the retracting film. Correct energy approach (accounting for mass flux): Energy released per unit time: ̇𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑 = 2 ⋅ 𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ 2𝜋𝑅 ⋅ 𝑣𝑓 This energy goes into: 1. Kinetic energy of material in the rim (moving at velocity 𝑣𝑓 ) 2. Heat dissipation (if any) If we assume all energy becomes kinetic: 1 2 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 𝑣2 𝑓 = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ 2𝜋𝑅 ⋅ 𝑣𝑓 The mass flux into the rim: 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 = 𝜌 ⋅ (2𝜋𝑅) ⋅ ℎ0 ⋅ 𝑣𝑓 Substituting: 1 2 𝜌(2𝜋𝑅ℎ0)𝑣2 𝑓 ⋅ 𝑣𝑓 = 4𝜋𝛾𝑓𝑎𝑅𝑣𝑓 𝑣2 𝑓 = 4𝛾𝑓𝑎 𝜌ℎ0 𝑣𝑓 = √ 4𝛾𝑓𝑎 𝜌ℎ0 (Dupré–Rayleigh prediction) 2. The Momentum Perspective (G. I. Taylor, 1959) 4 G. I. Taylor (1905–1975), one of the greatest fluid mechanicists, approached the problem differently: he used momentum conservation instead of energy. Newton’s second law: Force = Rate of momentum change Forces on the film: - Surface tension acts on the perimeter of the film at both interfaces - Total force: 𝐹 = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎(2𝜋𝑅) (pointing inward, opposing motion) Rate of momentum change: The film is being pulled inward by surface tension. The material in the rim has momentum 𝑝 = 𝑚𝑣. 𝑑𝑝 𝑑𝑡 = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎(2𝜋𝑅) For material flowing into the rim at velocity 𝑣𝑓 : 𝑑 𝑑𝑡 (𝑚𝑣𝑓 ) = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎(2𝜋𝑅) This gives: 𝑣𝑓 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 + 𝑚 𝑑𝑣𝑓 𝑑𝑡 = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎(2𝜋𝑅) Assuming steady-state ( 𝑑𝑣𝑓 𝑑𝑡 = 0) and 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 = 𝜌(2𝜋𝑅)ℎ0𝑣𝑓 : 𝑣𝑓 ⋅ 𝜌(2𝜋𝑅)ℎ0𝑣𝑓 = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎(2𝜋𝑅) 𝜌ℎ0𝑣2 𝑓 = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 𝑣𝑓 = √ 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 𝜌ℎ0 (Taylor–Culick prediction) Remarkable fact: Taylor’s prediction agrees with experiments! This immediately suggested that the energy approach was wrong—but why? 5 3. The Missing Link: Inelastic Collision (de Gennes, 1996) Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, a master of soft matter physics (Nobel Prize 1991), provided the decisive resolution in a 1996 Faraday Discussion paper: [!important] The Key Insight The film material does not smoothly flow into the retracting rim. Instead, it collides inelastically with the rim, dissipating energy. This is a plastic collision, not an elastic process. Energy Budget with Dissipation When the soap film retracts, the material at the film edge joins the rim. This material transition is inelastic: • Before collision: Film material moves inward at velocity 𝑣𝑓 • After collision: It joins the rim, which is also moving at 𝑣𝑓 • Energy dissipated: The “thickness” direction has an inelastic collision component 6 The energy dissipation rate from the inelastic collision: ̇𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 = 1 2 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 𝑣2 𝑓 This is exactly the kinetic energy of the material losing its transverse motion as it merges into the rim. Complete Energy Balance Let’s now account for all energy flows: Energy released by surface tension: ̇𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑 = 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ 2𝜋𝑅 ⋅ 𝑣𝑓 = 4𝜋𝛾𝑓𝑎𝑅𝑣𝑓 Energy dissipated (inelastic collision): ̇𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 = 1 2 𝑑𝑚 𝑑𝑡 𝑣2 𝑓 = 1 2 𝜌(2𝜋𝑅ℎ0)𝑣𝑓 ⋅ 𝑣2 𝑓 = 𝜋𝜌𝑅ℎ0𝑣3 𝑓 Energy conservation (with dissipation): ̇𝐸𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑑 = ̇𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 + ̇𝐸𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐 4𝜋𝛾𝑓𝑎𝑅𝑣𝑓 = 2𝜋𝜌𝑅ℎ0𝑣3 𝑓 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 = 𝜌ℎ0𝑣2 𝑓 7 𝑣𝑓 = √ 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 𝜌ℎ0 (Corrected energy prediction!) Resolving the Apparent Contradiction The resolution lies in momentum conservation vs. energy conservation: Why Momentum Conservation Works Momentum balance directly applies regardless of dissipation: Force = 𝑑𝑝 𝑑𝑡 This is valid whether the process is elastic or inelastic. The surface tension force acts on the film perimeter, and momentum is conserved: 𝑣𝑓 = √ 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 𝜌ℎ0 ✓ Why the Original Energy Balance Failed The error in the Dupré–Rayleigh approach was assuming that only kinetic energy matters. 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ 2𝜋𝑅 ⋅ 𝑣𝑓 = 𝑑 𝑑𝑡 [ 1 2 𝑚𝑣2 𝑓 ] But this neglected dissipation as the film material is “compressed” into the rim. The correct energy balance is: 2𝛾𝑓𝑎 ⋅ 2𝜋𝑅 ⋅ 𝑣𝑓 = 𝑑 𝑑𝑡 [ 1 2 𝑚𝑣2 𝑓 ] + ̇𝐸dissipation The “missing” energy ̇𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙 goes into: - Deforming the fluid from a thin film to the thicker rim - Viscous dissipation at high shear rates - Acoustic waves (shock waves in the fluid) The Ohnesorge Number and Flow Regimes The dynamics of film retraction depend on the balance between surface tension (driving the flow) and viscosity (resisting it). 8 Ohnesorge number: 𝑂ℎ = 𝜂 √𝜌𝛾𝑓𝑎ℎ0 where 𝜂 is the dynamic viscosity. • Low 𝑂ℎ regime: Inertia-dominated, momentum conservation dominates • High 𝑂ℎ regime: Viscous-dominated, viscous stresses important The classical Taylor–Culick speed 𝑣𝑓 = √2𝛾𝑓𝑎/(𝜌ℎ0) applies in the low-𝑂ℎ (inertial) regime. Experimental Validation and Simulations Modern high-speed imaging and numerical simulations have beautifully confirmed the resolution: Key observations: - Bursting films retract at speeds very close to Taylor’s prediction - Velocity field shows strong acceleration from rest to 𝑣𝑓 - Dissipation concentrates near the retracting edge (the rim region) - The flow becomes increasingly complex at high Oh (viscoelastic effects emerge) 9 Simulations reveal that the velocity profile is not uniform—there’s acceleration from the edge into the rim, and stress concentrations that lead to localized dissipation.

Culick Independent confirmation; bubble breakup dynamics 1996 P.-G. de Gennes Complete resolution via inelastic collision and energy dissipation [!note] On the importance of this problem The Taylor–Culick paradox exemplifies a deep prin- ciple: momentum conservation is always valid, but energy conservation requires accounting for dissipation mechanisms. This lesson transfers to many soft matter phenomena where interfaces dominate. Key Takeaways 1. Momentum conservation is robust. The Taylor–Culick speed 𝑣𝑓 = √2𝛾𝑓𝑎/(𝜌ℎ0) follows directly from force balance and does not depend on details of energy dissipation. 2. Energy dissipation is not negligible. The naive energy-balance approach fails because it ignores the inelastic collision process—energy is not smoothly converted to kinetic energy alone. 3. Multiple equilibrium approaches. For the same physical process, different conservation laws give dif- ferent perspectives. Momentum is fundamental; energy requires accounting for all sinks. 4. Time and dissipation matter. In soft matter, the rate of process (viscosity, Ohnesorge number) critically determines dynamics. Fast retraction (low Oh) is momentum-dominated; slow retraction (high Oh) is viscous-dominated. 5. Paradoxes resolve through careful accounting. Many apparent contradictions in physics arise from incomplete accounting of energy or momentum sinks/sources. Always ask: “Where did the energy/momentum go?” 11 Further Reading Primary Literature • G. I. Taylor, Proc. R. Soc. A, 253, 313–321 (1959) — Classic momentum-balance derivation • F. E. C. Culick, J.

Homework (Self-Assessed) [!check] Reflection Questions 12 Q1. In the energy-balance approach, why does neglecting dissipation lead to a speed that’s √2 times faster than observed? Q2. Explain in words why momentum conservation “just works” even though energy dissipation is important. Why is momentum balance insensitive to the details of how energy is dissipated? Q3. Consider a highly viscous soap film (large 𝜂, large Ohnesorge number). Would you expect the retraction speed to be faster or slower than Taylor’s prediction? Explain your reasoning using scaling arguments. Q4.
