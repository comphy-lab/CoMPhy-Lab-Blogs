Its mechanism differs from the familiar, inertia-driven turbulence in Newtonian fluids and is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of purely elastic pressure-driven channel flows of dilute polymer solutions are organized by exact coherent structures that take the form of two-dimensional traveling waves. Our results demonstrate that no linear instability is required to sustain such traveling wave solutions and that their origin is purely elastic in nature. We show that the associated stress profiles are characterized by thin, filamentlike arrangements of polymer stretch, which is sustained by a solitary pair of vortices. We discuss the implications of the traveling wave solutions for the transition to elastic turbulence in straight channels and propose ways for their detection in experiments.
