The flow structures may happen to promote the stirring and dispersion of the particles. But the opposite can also take place and the flow configuration may contribute to the focussing and accumulation of particles within specific regions of the flow. This work explores how a collection (i.e. a cloud) of heavy particles evolves under gravity in a complex flow (i.e. large vortices). The key question is whether the cloud maintains a cohesive entity or disintegrates and spreads. The objective is to tackle the interplay between the multibody particle interactions and the interaction between the particles and the spatial structures of the flow. This coupling is examined for a cloud of heavy spheres settling in a cellular flow field which is a simple model flow capturing key features of vortical effects on the particles. The focus here is on flow regimes where inertia is small but can become finite. This work has been undertaken with Laurence Bergougnoux and Benjamin Marchetti at Aix-Marseille Université, CNRS, IUSTI, Marseille, France. 2 Evening Lecture by Prof. Leif Ristroph \"The Feynman Sprinkler, and a Sprinkling of Related Problems” Leif Ristroph has a MSc degree (2007) and a PhD degree (2011), both in Physics from Cornell University. He currently is Associate Professor of Mathematics at New York University’s Courant Institute. He is an experimental physicist and applied mathematician who specializes in fluid dynamics, with a particular emphasis on fluid-structure interactions as applied to biological and geophysical flows. His biophysical work includes studies of the aerodynamics and stabilization of insect flight as well as the hydrodynamics of schooling and flow-sensing in swimming fish. Relevant to geophysical flows, he is interested in problems ranging from instabilities of interfacial flows to the evolution of shape during fluid mechanical erosion Abstract of lecture. Fluids, if urged to move reversely through or around some geometry, do not simply reverse course but rather generate entirely different patterns and currents. This fact about flows with inertia has many interesting consequences and practical applications. The lecture gives some curious examples of natural systems and engineered devices that rely on fluid mechanical irreversibility. The main focus is on the tough and enduring mystery of the so-called reverse sprinkler problem, which has remained unsolved for 140 years and which we have very recently made progress on. This and the other problems will hopefully show how questions from fluid mechanics can impact so many other disciplines and can inspire new and interesting math, physics, and engineering ideas. KIVI Hoogendoorn Fluid Mechanics Award for dr. Vatsal Sanjay He defended his PhD thesis (with Cum Laude distinction) on 15th July 2022 at the University of Twente, with promotor prof. Detlef Lohse. The thesis is entitled: “Viscous Free-Surface Flows”. This thesis investigates several free- surface phenomena to illustrate the role of viscous stresses. The study includes the impact of spherical liquid drops on non-wetting substrates, with a focus on capillary-driven retraction of films and bursting of free-surface bubbles. The three-fluid model developed in this thesis can thus be used as a base model to incorporate multi- physical aspects, such as Marangoni flows and multicomponent systems. 2023 Leen van Wijngaarden Prize for dr. ir. Sander Huisman The Leen van Wijngaarden Prize for excellence in Fluid Mechanics is awarded every four years for a researcher less than 40 years of age affiliated with one of the groups of the JM Burgerscentrum. The prize is intended for an important and interesting contribution to fluid mechanics. The work of Sander Huisman was selected for the depth and breath, and scope of the research, incorporating the complete research cycle from design to implementation and data analysis, as well as the worldwide impact his research has created. His papers are a delight to read and study. 3 Wednesday 29th May 2024 09:30 – 10:30 Registration with coffee/tea 10:30 – 10:40 Opening in Room “Earth” Hans van Duijn – Opening by the Chair of the Board of the Burgerscentrum Ruud Henkes – Welcome by the Scientific Director of the Burgerscentrum 10:40 – 11:30 Burgers Lecture in Room “Earth” Prof. Elisabeth Guazzelli (Université Paris Cité, France) – The 2024 Burgers Lecture “Falling clouds of particles in vortical flows” 11:30 – 12:30 Fluid Flow Impact (Room “Earth”) (Chair: Tim Peeters) Hans Meerman (Industrial R&D): Fluid Flow in Process Engineering David Fernandez Rivas (University of Twente): Entrepreneurial Physics and Empathic Engineering Jos van ‘t Westende (TNO): The drag reduction project Claas Willem Visser (IAMFLUIDICS): Fluid mechanics in industrialization and upscaling of in-air microfluidics Varsha Kapoerchan (NWO): Physics of Fluids and Soft Matter 12:30 – 13:30 Lunch (Separate lunch meeting for members of Industrial Advisory Board in Meeting Room 9) 4 Wednesday, 29 th May 2024 13:30 – 14:30 Parallel Sessions Room “Earth” Room “Air” Aerodynamics & Turbulence (Chair: Dominik Krug) Computational Methods (Chair: Maike Baltussen) Abdelrahman Hisham Hassanein (TUD – Aerodynamics – Woutijn Baars): Attenuating the energy of large structures via inner-scaled Helmholtz resonators under a turbulent boundary layer grazing flow Alessandro Ballatore (TU/e – Power Flow – Jeroen van Oijen): LES of reacting high-pressure DI-H2 with tabulated chemistry Laurens-Jan Lagendijk (TUD – Ship Hydromechanics – Tom van Terwisga): Working principles and simulation of flexible ship propellers Chang Wang (RUG -
