Aquatic ecosystems are frequently used as receiving environments for wastewater discharges, which can lead to complex phenomena impacting the ecosystem. To mitigate and manage these adverse effects, a thorough understanding of the interactions between effluents and receiving environments is crucial for promoting sound environmental management practices. To this end, the current study investigates the behavior of a warm jet in crossflow when released near the surface at the confluence of channels. This paper specifically examines how discharge location and velocity affect the jet's trajectory, dilution, and mixing efficiency. Using OpenFOAM for numerical simulations, we analyzed jets introduced into both the main and tributary channels, with a focus on different discharge velocities, particularly low-velocity discharges (Fr near one), which remain underexplored in the existing literature. Using the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model, the numerical results showed strong agreement with experimental data, with an average error of approximately 4%, validating the model's accuracy. Key findings reveal that the confluence shear layer plays a significant role in shaping jet trajectories and enhancing mixing efficiency. Jets discharged in the main channel exhibited longer trajectories and greater interaction with ambient flow, resulting in higher dilution rates for both low- and high-velocity jets. Low-velocity jets were found to behave independently of jet velocity upon reaching the confluence, with their path being altered by the shear layer. Conversely, jets released in the tributary maintained a more consistent trajectory, unaffected by confluence dynamics. Keywords: fluid mechanics, LES, rigid lid, confluence, OPENFOAM, surface positive jet 1. Introduction Water quality standards have imposed restrictions on the release of pollutants generated by various industrial processes. Examples include discharge from desalination units, sewage, and waste heat into rivers or oceans. To address these pollution challenges, a thorough understanding of the detailed features of turbulent dispersion and efficient mixing of waste effluent with the ambient environment is essential. These discharges can occur horizontally, vertically, or at an angle, into either stagnant or flowing environments. When jets are released into the main stream, this scenario is referred to as a \"jet in crossflow\" (Eleshaky, 2008). Many researchers have investigated the complexity of jets in crossflow (Godasiaei & Kamali, 2024; Gupta & Saha, 2024; Zhang, 2024). However, this complexity can be further intensified when jets are released in areas with intricate river geometries, such as confluence regions, as studied by (Behzad, Rennie, et al., 2024). To the best of the authors' knowledge, no numerical investigations have focused on the mixing of jets in confluence zones, particularly for low- velocity discharges (Froude number near one). This study aims to assess the accuracy of CFD simulations for surface positively buoyant effluent discharges in confluence areas and evaluate the impact of the junction on the outfall. Additionally, it seeks to extend previous experimental investigations by exploring different discharge flow rates and confluence flow rate ratios. 1.1. Jet in crossflow A jet in crossflow occurs when a jet of fluid enters and interacts with a crossflowing fluid. (Andreopoulos & Rodi, 1984) observed that both the jet and the crossflow are deflected during this interaction. The crossflow bends the jet, while the crossflow itself is diverted as it encounters the jet, which behaves like a rigid obstacle when the jet momentum is sufficiently high. This interaction causes the jet to mix with and entrain fluid from the deflected flow. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 2 of 21 When the ratio of jet velocity to ambient velocity is high, the jet is slightly affected near the exit and penetrates further into the crossflow before curving (Meftah et al., 2015). (Pathak et al., 2006) identified four main vortical structures that characterize the flow field of a jet in crossflow: (i) shear layer vortices, which form at the interface between the jet and the crossflow and are associated with Kelvin- Helmholtz instabilities; (ii) horseshoe vortices, caused by the adverse pressure gradient upstream of the jet; (iii) wake vortices, which develop within the inner part of the jet; and (iv) counter-rotating vortex pairs (CRVP), which form in the cross plane just after the jet exit and become dominant structures further downstream The phenomenon of jets in crossflow has been explored extensively through both experimental and numerical methods over the years (Angelidis, 2002; Behzad, Rennie, et al., 2024; Kumar & Mukhopadhyay, 2024). A comprehensive review of these experimental and numerical investigations on the topic, covering recent decades, is provided by (Taherian & Mohammadian, 2021). Effluent discharges that are less dense than the receiving fluid are common in both natural and engineered systems. A typical example is the release of warm water from power plant cooling towers into rivers, often as a surface discharge due to its cost-effectiveness. However, surface discharges generally carry higher environmental risks compared to submerged alternatives (Jones et al., 2007). The jet trajectory is determined by connecting points with the highest time-averaged concentration at each cross- section (Figure 1). The angle 𝜃 represents the jet’s inclination, indicating the direction of instantaneous velocity along the central axis relative to the crossflow. 𝜃₀ refers to the initial angle, while 𝜃 represents the angles along the jet’s trajectory (Behzad, Rennie, et al., 2024). Figure 1. Schematic shape of the surface jet in crossflow (Top View). Terms are defined in the text. One of the pioneering studies on jets was conducted by Pratte and Baines (Pratte & Baines, 1967), who examined jet trajectories for various jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios. Additionally, early work on predicting surface discharge behavior through mathematical modeling was done by (Dunn et al., 1975) and (McGuirk & Rodi, 1978, 1979). These efforts were aimed at understanding the characteristics of discharges in both stagnant and crossflow conditions. (Jirka et al., 1981) were the first to introduce length-scale parameters for classifying buoyant surface jets. Subsequently, (Chu & Jirka, 1986) provided an initial framework for classifying buoyant surface jets in crossflows. Building on this foundation, (Jones et al., 2007) developed a more comprehensive classification system, categorizing surface jets based on the following dimensionless parameters: 𝐿𝑄 = 𝑄0/𝑀1/2 0 (1) 𝐿𝑀 = 𝑀3/4 0 /𝐽 1/2 0 (2) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 3 of 21 𝑙𝑚 = 𝑀1/2 0 /𝑢𝑎 (3) 𝑙𝑏 = 𝐽0/𝑢𝑎3 (4) With 𝑄0 = 𝑢0𝑎0 𝑀0 = 𝑢0𝑄0 𝐽0 = 𝑄0 𝑔′0 𝑔′0 = 𝑔(∆𝜌0/𝜌0) The terms are defined as follows: 𝐿𝑄 represent Discharge length scale, 𝐿𝑀 denotes Jet-to-plume length scale, 𝑙𝑚 is Jet- to-crossflow length scale, and 𝑙𝑏 signifies Plume-to-crossflow length scale. where Q0 is the jet flow rate, M0 is the jet momentum flux, J0 is the jet buoyancy flux, a0 represents the cross-sectional area of the jet, g is the gravitational acceleration, ρ is the water density, and Δρ0 is the difference in the discharge density (Δρ0= ρa− ρ0). A surface buoyant jet in crossflow can be divided into four distinct asymptotic regimes depending on whether buoyancy, momentum, or crossflow predominantly affects the jet's mixing characteristics (Figure 1) (Taherian & Mohammadian, 2021): - Momentum Dominated Near-Field (y/lm << 1): the jet's behavior is primarily controlled by its initial momentum. - Momentum Dominated Far-Field (y/lm >> 1): its discharge becomes strongly influenced by the crossflow. - Buoyancy Dominated Near-Field (y/lb << 1): the plume's motion is mainly driven by its initial buoyancy. Buoyancy Dominated Far-Field (y/lb >> 1): the plume's discharge is largely governed by the effects of the crossflow. In this context, y denotes the cross-channel distance. (Figure 1). This study specifically investigated the Momentum-Dominated Near-Field and the Buoyancy-Dominated Far-Field regimes. In a recent study, (Gharavi et al., 2020) utilized experimental techniques to deepen the understanding of the three- dimensional velocity field of surface buoyant jets in crossflow environments. Using Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (Stereo-PIV), they captured both spatial and temporal velocity distributions downstream of the jet discharge point. Their findings revealed the formation and development of vortices within the jet's flow structure, resembling half of the counter-rotating vortex pairs (CVPs) typically observed in submerged jets. This asymmetry was attributed to the interaction with the water surface, which acted as a plane of symmetry, suppressing one of the vortices. Key flow characteristics such as turbulent kinetic energy were measured and dissipation rate was calculated, providing insights into the complex mixing mechanisms at play in surface jets. (Behzad, Rennie, et al., 2024) expanded upon this research by utilizing Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) to obtain the first measurements of effluent discharges at channel confluences. Their systematic investigations focused on the dynamics of positively buoyant surface jets, employing experimental techniques to study the complex behavior of jets entering confluence zones under various hydrodynamic conditions. The study demonstrated that jet trajectories are influenced by both the discharge location and the confluence flow ratio. 1.2. Open Channel Confluence The convergence of two open channels is common in natural river systems as well as in various hydraulic structures such as wastewater treatment plants and fish passage systems (Weber et al., 2001). This confluence triggers mass and momentum transfer across the mixing layer between the two streams, significantly affecting the temporal and spatial distribution of pollutants within the rivers (Yuan et al., 2016). The flow behavior near a confluence is complex and is influenced by factors such as the free surface, upstream conditions in both the main and branch channels, and formation of a separation zone downstream of the confluence [3]. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 4 of 21 River channel confluence flow dynamics have been examined and are typically divided into six key regions: flow stagnation, deflection, separation, maximum velocity, recovery, and distinct shear layers (Figure 2) [7]. The location and size of these zones are determined by the ratio of the discharge between the two incoming streams and the angle of the river confluence [8]. Figure 2. Flow characteristics in channel confluences (based on Best, 1987 [7]) Due to advancements in measuring devices and computer technology, it is now feasible to accurately capture and describe the three-dimensional flow structure, material transport, bed changes, and biological and environmental impacts of river confluences (Behzad, Mohammadian, et al., 2024). As a result, recent years have witnessed an increase in research on river confluences (Liu et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2024). The flow dynamics, turbulent coherent structures, and turbulence characteristics at confluences have been extensively studied (Wang et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2022). Field investigation conducted by (Roy & Bergeron, 1990) highlighted the occurrence of flow separation zones and recirculation at downstream confluence corners in nature. (Ashmore et al., 1992) measured the flow field at a natural confluence, finding that flow velocity accelerates sharply at the confluence junction, with two separate high-velocity cores merging into a single core at the channel center. (De Serres et al., 1999) conducted a three-dimensional analysis of flow structures in river confluences, identifying mixing layers, stagnation zones, separation zones, and recovery zones. Numerical studies, such as that of (Sharifipour et al., 2015), investigated the flow structure in a 90° confluence, finding that the size of the separation zone decreases as the width ratio between the tributary and the main channel increases. (Behzad, Mohammadian, et al., 2024) explored the fluid dynamics of open channel confluences, focusing on the impact of bed deformation, which is often overlooked in past studies. Using OpenFOAM, they simulated flow with both flat and degraded beds, applying six turbulence models, including RANS, LES, and DES, and used rigid lid and VoF methods. LES performed best, with a 3% normalized mean square error (NRMSE) under VoF and 17% under the rigid lid. Their findings revealed that the recirculation zone was shorter or absent near the bed in degraded cases, altering secondary flow patterns. Additionally, vortical structures and circulation within the separation zone were strongly influenced by bed shape and channel geometry. 1.3. Objective Physical models, despite their widespread use, are often limited by scale effects, while field studies tend to be labor- and time-intensive, with results heavily dependent on the precision of measurement techniques. As a result, numerical simulations offer a cost-effective alternative for investigating complex flow phenomena (Behzad, Mohammadian, et al., 2024). Despite numerous studies on confluence channels and jets in crossflow, a significant gap remains in the literature, in that the interaction between these two complex flow fields has not been studied. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the only investigation into the dynamics of positively buoyant surface jets in confluence regions was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 5 of 21 recently conducted by the authors of this study (Behzad, Rennie, et al., 2024), and no numerical analysis has been performed to date. Recognizing this research gap, the present study seeks to conduct a comprehensive LES investigation of surface crossflow jets advecting through a channel confluence. Additionally, this study aims to extend previous experimental results by simulating low velocity plume-like jets than could be achieved in the physical model. The primary goal is to understand the behavior and trajectory of pollutants released in confluence areas, providing insights for effective mitigation strategies and minimizing environmental impacts. 2. Numerical Methodology 2.1. Governing Equations 2.1.1. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model In this study, transport of momentum and mass is computed by the nondimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with an advection-diffusion equation for scalar transport. An implicit-filtering-based Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method was employed to directly resolve large-scale flow structures while filtering out the smaller scales. The coupling between momentum and buoyancy forces is modeled using the Boussinesq approximation, since the density difference between the dense jet and the ambient fluid is less than 10%. The governing equations are nondimensionalized and expressed as follows (Nicoud & Ducros, 1999; Pope, n.d.). ∂𝑢𝑖 ∂𝑥𝑖 = 0 (5) ∂𝑢𝑖 ∂𝑡 + ∂𝑢𝑖𝑢𝑗 ∂𝑥𝑗 = ― ∂𝑝 ∂𝑥𝑖 + 1 𝑅𝑒 ∂2𝑢𝑖 ∂𝑥𝑗∂𝑥𝑗 ― ∂τ𝑖𝑗 ∂𝑥𝑗 + 𝑒𝑔 𝑖 1 𝐹𝑟2 𝑐 , (6) ∂𝑐 ∂𝑡 + ∂𝑢𝑖𝑐 ∂𝑥𝑖 = 1 𝑅𝑒𝑆𝑐 ∂2𝑐 ∂𝑥𝑖∂𝑥𝑖 ― ∂τ 𝑐 𝑖 ∂𝑥𝑖 𝑧 , (7) where indices (𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3) correspond to the spatial dimensions, 𝑢𝑖 shows the (𝑖)-th component of the velocity, and 𝑝 represents the pressure. The kinematic viscosity is denoted by ν, 𝑡 is time and subgrid-scale (SGS) stress tensor is expressed as (τ𝑖𝑗). The gravitational acceleration acts in the direction of the unit vector (𝑒𝑔 𝑖 = (0, ― 1,0)), and (𝑐) stands for the jet concentration. Throughout this study, variables with a tilde (   ) are dimensionless and filtered. Dimensionless variables are defined using characteristic scales of length, velocity, and time, as detailed in Table 1.

For a comprehensive discussion of this formulation, please refer to (Nicoud & Ducros, 1999; Sagaut, 2006). 2.2. Numerical framework This study utilized OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation), a widely recognized open-source CFD tool implemented in C++ and commonly used in hydraulic engineering (Imanian & Mohammadian, 2019; Jacobsen et al., 2012). Specifically, the PimpleFoam solver, a rigid lid model within OpenFOAM, was employed. An implicit Euler time scheme was used for temporal discretization, while spatial discretization involved Gauss linear schemes for gradient, divergence, interpolation, and wall distance calculations. The Gauss linear scheme was employed for solving the cell gradient. The numerical models were developed based on the configuration of the physical model described in the subsequent section (Luo et al., 2024). In this study, snappyHexMesh was used to generate the mesh, as illustrated in Figure 3. The numerical domain was designed to match the physical dimensions of the experimental field. The grid size gradually increases outward from each boundary, ensuring a smooth grid transition, which is crucial for maintaining numerical stability. The meshes were graded to achieve higher resolution, specifically in the confluence zone Figure 3. Mesh grids of the domain in the OpenFOAM platform were visualized on a scale of 1 to 5 to illustrate the distribution of the mesh grids. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 7 of 21 2.2.1. Hydraulic conditions A three-dimensional unstructured grid, shown in Figure 4, was set up for the computational analysis. A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system was used, with the x-axis increasing in the crossflow direction and the y-axis extending upward from the channel floor. The computational domain has physical dimensions of 10 cm in height, with the main channel width of 20 cm and the tributary channel width of 15 cm. This domain, modeled as a rectangular box, corresponds to a section of the recirculating water channel used in the experiments by (Behzad, Rennie, et al., 2024). The experimental study evaluated two scenarios for surface thermal jet discharge: one with the jet released in the main upstream channel and the other in the tributary channel. The jet diameter was 4 mm, and the jet exit was located 20 cm upstream of the junction, near the water surface. A grid clustering technique was applied near the jet inlet and wall surfaces to enhance resolution in critical areas (Behzad, Mohammadian, et al., 2024). As will be shown below, a TKE ratio test was conducted (Eleshaky, 2008; Pirzadeh, 1994), indicating that a grid size of 8,140,198 tetrahedral cells provides satisfactory accuracy. During these tests, careful attention was given to maintaining the location of the first grid point near the wall, even as the total number of grid points was varied. The summary of the hydraulic and geometric data is presented in Table 2. This data has been used for model validation, ensuring that the numerical simulations accurately reflect the physical conditions of the experiments. Table 2.

Flow depth in all scenarios was 0.10 m, but the jet and channel discharges varied. The effects of these scenarios were thoroughly analyzed, and their implications are discussed in the subsequent sections of this paper. Further investigation focused on the impact of a low-velocity discharge (Fr = 1) in confluence regions (R5,6,9, and 10), which could not be achieved in laboratory experiments due to limitations in physical models and instrumentation. While all previous experimental runs (Behzad, Rennie, et al., 2024) involved jet-like, momentum-dominated flows in the confluences, this study aims to examine plume-like behavior for the first time. Furthermore, four runs (R7 to R10) were conducted to investigate the effect of the confluence flow ratio on the jet trajectory, to examine how varying flow conditions at the confluence influence the mixing and dispersion patterns of the discharged jet.

This case followed the experimental conditions specified in Table 1 with a 30° channel confluence with a discharge ratio of RQ=0.15, where RQ=Qt/Qm, with Qt and Qm representing the discharges of the upstream tributary and main channels, respectively. The jet was released from the Jet-1 location in the main channel (see Figure 4) with a velocity (uj) of 0.06 m/s. The jet properties for case R1 are shown in Table 2. Figure 4. Measured sections, validation profiles for the simulation area and boundary conditions of the flume. Yellow circles mark the profiles that are used to compare the modeled and measured data. 2.3. Boundary Condition To achieve fully developed turbulent flow, the jet inlet and channels are defined by the mapped inlet boundary condition as defined in (Goodarzi, 2024). The first inflow boundary corresponds to the jet exit, positioned at the water surface. The second and third inflow boundaries are for the main channel and tributary entrances. These profiles were established to match the experimentally determined velocity for both the jet and the crossflow. A no-slip condition was imposed at the nozzle wall, as well as at the channel walls and floor, while the water surface was treated with a slip condition. Water discharge rates were prescribed at the inlets, and a zero-gradient condition was applied at the outlet. Additionally, a flow depth of 10 cm was maintained throughout each model run, consistent with the experimental runs. 2.4. Verification of Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) According to Pope (2004) (Pope, 2004) effective use of LES models requires that at least 80% of the TKE be resolved on the computational mesh. The resolved TKE is represented by the equation: Kres = 1 2(u ′ 2 + v ′ 2 + w ′ 2) (22) where u ′ , v ′ , and w ′ denote the velocity fluctuations in the streamwise, lateral, and vertical directions, respectively, and the overbars signify time-averaging. In the simulations conducted, more than 80% of the cells in all cases meet this requirement, demonstrating that the mesh is adequately resolving the turbulent kinetic energy for the LES model (Figure 5). This indicates that the mesh quality is sufficient for accurately capturing the turbulence characteristics essential for effective LES modeling. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 9 of 21 Figure 5. Proportion of TKE resolved on the mesh 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Model Validation Before demonstrating the capabilities of the current computational methodology, it is crucial to evaluate its accuracy in the present flow cases. In general, quantifying computational uncertainty is challenging for problems without exact solutions. However, an effective indicator of computational error is the comparison of the numerical results with available experimental data. Figure 6A shows the velocity streamlines for Case R1, while Figure 6B presents the velocity stramlines for Case R7, demonstrating the key flow features in confluence regions. As shown, all six characteristic confluence features are evident in Figure 6B. The authors selected Case R7 due to its high confluence flow rate ratio, the largest among all the simulated cases. This particular scenario also led to the formation of a small separation zone, further emphasizing the influence of flow dynamics in confluence areas. In contrast, due to the lower velocity ratio in Figure 6A, no separation zone is observed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 10 of 21 Figure 6.

Figure 7 presents for case R1 the computed and experimentally measured (Behzad, Rennie, et al., 2024) time-averaged streamwise velocity profiles at four measurement locations within the symmetry plane: X/D = -50, Y/D = 25, and X/D = 250; Y/D = 10, 25, and 40. The velocities are normalized by the mean jet velocity. It is evident from the figure that the computed streamwise velocity profiles align well with the experimental data. The velocity distribution within the confluence is generally predictable. Overall, there is good agreement between the computed and measured velocity profiles in the confluence region. Figure 7.

The height of channel is (𝑦 = 𝑌 𝐷𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑢 = 𝑢𝑎 𝑢𝑗). Experimental velocity measurements were obtained with a Nortek Vectrino Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). The differences between the predicted flow velocities and the experimental data appear to be minor. However, a detailed statistical analysis is necessary to quantify these discrepancies. To achieve this, the root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated to provide a more rigorous comparison between the model predictions and observed data (Table 4).

The jet widening profiles at four locations along the symmetry plane of the main channel are shown in Figure 8. This figure illustrates the normalized concentration profiles across various cross-sections perpendicular to the jet's central trajectory. The experimental data were obtained using Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) [5]. The parameter \"bc\" represents the distance from the jet centerline to the point where the concentration drops to 𝑒−1𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑥, with 𝐶𝑚𝑎𝑥 indicating the peak tracer concentration along the centerline. Additionally, this figure shows a slightly wider profile for the numerical results, suggesting that part of the jet may not have been fully captured in the experiment. Figure 8.

Another flow comparison is shown in Figure 9, where the experimental flow visualization (Behzad, Rennie, et al., 2024) of the jet cross-section is compared with the predicted mean velocity profile () at the symmetry plane for Case R1. As seen, the computed velocity profile closely matches the laboratory observations in terms of the overall size and structure of the jet. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 12 of 21 Figure 9.

The comparison highlights how reasonable the computational predictions match the experimental observations, demonstrating the model's capability to accurately capture the key flow features.

Jet Flow Development Figure 11 presents the contours of the mean velocity field for horizontal cross-sections at the nozzle elevation at the surface for three simulated flow cases. These velocity contours offer a clear depiction of flow development. Two of the three cases were under identical confluence hydraulic conditions, while Case C had a higher tributary flow thus a higher flow ratio. In the case of R1 (Figure 11A), a strong initial jet is observed, with the flow extending to the channel width. This diminishes as the jet velocity decreases (Case R3, Figure 11B). It is evident that the velocity ratio significantly influences jet flow development before the junction. Case R7 demonstrates how the confluence flow can alter the jet trajectory (Figure 11C). In all three cases, the jets are influenced by the confluence's shear layer near the junction, which pushes the flow further away from the inner bank. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 13 of 21 Figure 11. Flow development for (A) R1, (B) R3, and (C) R7; contour plots showing the concentration distribution at the surface. 3.2.2. Jet trajectory The jet trajectory is defined as the path along which the concentration is highest (Taherian et al., n.d.). This trajectory is determined by calculating the maximum concentration in ten cross-sectional planes perpendicular to the x-direction and then connecting these points, as shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for two different scenarios: jet discharge in the main channel and the tributary branch channel. Figure 12. Jet trajectory for the cases with Jet-1. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 14 of 21 Many researchers have demonstrated that the trajectory of a jet released in an open channel can be influenced by the velocity ratio between the jet and the crossflow (Taherian et al., n.d.). When the jet velocity is low relative to the crossflow, the jet remains close to the point of release, and if the nozzle is located near the shoreline, the jet tends to follow the shoreline until it is fully diluted. As the velocity ratio increases, the jet spreads further into the channel or river width. However, as shown in Figure 12, the presence of a junction can alter this behavior. At the confluence, the jet trajectory becomes less dependent on the velocity ratio. Even for low-velocity jets (such as R5 & 9), while the initial jet behavior aligns with prior research, upon reaching the confluence, the jets are impacted by the confluence shear layer and are deflected towards the outer bank, following a nearly identical path regardless of the initial velocity. The key distinction is that lower-velocity jets dilute more quickly into the ambient water. This finding is crucial for outfall designers to predict jet behavior in various scenarios, ensuring the mitigation of pollutant impact and compliance with environmental regulations. Figure 13. Jet trajectory for the cases with Jet-2. Figure 13 demonstrates the jet trajectory when released into the tributary, highlighting that the jet moves along the inner bank, and its distribution is constrained by the confluence shear layer, limiting its spread across the channel width. Based on the results shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13, it is important for outfall designers to strategically position sensitive receptors, such as recreational areas. If these receptors are located near the inner bank, placing the jet outfall in the main channel could help restrict pollutants from reaching those areas. Conversely, if receptors are located near the outer bank, positioning the jet in the tributary may be more effective. As shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13, the jet released in the confluence area initially behaves similarly to flow in simple channels before reaching the junction. However, upon reaching the junction, the jet's behavior becomes almost independent of its initial characteristics and is predominantly controlled by the confluence dynamics. As illustrated in these figures, jets with varying initial flow rates (whether jet-like or plume-like) follow the same trajectory after passing the junction. The primary difference is that the plume-like jet dilutes faster, reaching less than one percent of its initial concentration more quickly than the higher flow rate jets. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 15 of 21 Figure 14. Concentration Distribution along X-Direction (A: R1&R5 and B: R2&R6) In this study, dilution is defined as reaching less than 1% of the initial concentration (C₀). The concentration distribution along the X-direction, expressed as a percentage of the initial concentration (C₀), is shown in Figure 14A. In this figure, R1 and R5 are presented as representatives of high and low-velocity jets, respectively. Both jets follow a similar trajectory, but the dilution behavior differs: the high-velocity jet (R1) dilutes into the ambient water approximately 350D downstream, while the low-velocity jet (R5) achieves dilution closer to 250D. This demonstrates the influence of jet velocity on the rate and extent of mixing with the surrounding flow. Figure 14B illustrates the concentration distribution along the X-direction for cases R2 and R6, which have the same flow rates as R1 and R5 but are released in the branch channel. The results show that the dilution of the jet in the tributary is slower compared to the main channel. This suggests that the flow conditions in the branch channel limit the mixing efficiency, causing the jet to remain concentrated for a longer distance downstream than in the main channel scenarios. 3.2.3. Cross-Section Visualization Figure 15 presents the concentration distribution of the jet along a transverse (y–z) plane at section X/D=10 for case R7. Jets discharged into crossflows exhibit greater mixing potential compared to free jets, as noted in previous studies (Coussement et al., 2012). This enhanced mixing capability is largely attributed to the formation of counter-rotating vortex pairs (CVPs) as the jet diffuses downstream into the crossflow (Cortelezzi & Karagozian, 2001). A key difference in jets with CVP structures is the presence of a vortex pair (one on each side of the symmetry plane) in vertical jets, as opposed to the single vortex typically observed in surface jets. It can be hypothesized that the water surface suppresses one of the vortices in a CVP, effectively creating a plane of symmetry for the flow structure (Gharavi et al., 2020). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 16 of 21 Figure 15. Concentration distribution contour across y-z plane at X/D=10 for R1 (top) and velocity vectors across y-z plane (bottom) 3.2.4. Streamlines Visualization Figure 16 illustrates the streamline trajectories of the flow for cases R1 and R7. Both cases have the same jet flow rate, but R7 has a higher confluence flow ratio due to a larger tributary flow. The figure highlights how changes in confluence hydrodynamics affect the jet trajectory. In case R1, with a lower confluence flow rate ratio, the jet experiences broader dispersion across the channel. As shown in the figure, the jet's width distribution is greater in this case, allowing for more extensive interaction with the surrounding crossflow. This results in a wider spread of the jet across the channel. On the other hand, in case R7, where the confluence flow rate ratio is higher, the stronger tributary flow pushes the confluence shear layer towards the outer wall, and this exerts greater control over the jet, leading to a more constrained trajectory and reduced lateral spread. The comparison of these two cases underscores the importance of the confluence flow rate ratio in determining jet behavior. A higher ratio tends to limit the jet's dispersion and could impact the efficiency of mixing and pollutant dilution. For designers and engineers, understanding these dynamics is critical for optimizing outfall systems, especially in ensuring that effluents are adequately diluted while minimizing environmental impacts. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 17 of 21 Figure 16. Streamlines Trajectories of the flow (top: R1 and below: R7) 3.2.5. Instantaneous Visualization In Case R1, the behavior of the jet progresses through two distinct phases. Initially, the jet maintains a well-defined structure, driven by its momentum. However, as the jet approaches the confluence, it begins to disperse and interact with the surrounding flow (Figure 17). At this stage, clusters of tracer fluid start to break away from the main jet stream (highlighted within the green rectangle) as it encounters the confluence’s shear layer, pushing the jet away from the inner bank. As highlighted in the green rectangle, only a small portion of the jet is able to penetrate the shear layer and move through the deflection region, entering the side of the tributary channel. This deviation significantly alters the jet’s trajectory, improving its mixing efficiency with the surrounding flow. This occurs due to the stable density gradient along the edge of the jet, where the lower-density jet fluid flows atop the denser ambient water. The resulting instability promotes enhanced mixing as the jet interacts with the denser environment. The increased interaction of the jet with the ambient fluid facilitates dynamic exchanges between the jet's momentum and the varying velocities at the confluence. The presence of rotating tracer fluid bundles, marked by yellow rectangles, reveals active mixing and redistribution of fluid properties, resulting in a more complex and diversified flow pattern. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 18 of 21 Figure 17. Instantaneous concentration flow fields for numerical case R1 In Case R2, where the jet is released into the tributary branch channel, the flow behavior is notably different from that in Case R1. Unlike the stronger dilution and dispersion observed in the main channel, the jet in Case R2 experiences reduced mixing efficiency. This is largely due to the confined nature of the branch channel and the absence of significant interaction with the main channel’s confluence flow dynamics. The jet within the branch channel flow is constrained by the confluence shear layer to remain near the inner wall, thus the jet does not undergo the same level of deviation or deflection as in Case R1. Consequently, the jet maintains a more concentrated flow, resulting in a lower dilution rate. The reduced interaction with ambient water leads to less dynamic mixing, as the jet retains its momentum without significant dispersion. This results in a more localized flow pattern, with tracer fluid remaining closer to the jet trajectory and exhibiting fewer rotating tracer fluid bundles, indicating limited mixing. Thus, in Case R2 (Figure 18), the jet’s lower dilution is primarily due to the restricted flow environment in the branch channel, which limits the jet’s interaction with the ambient flow, reducing its overall mixing efficiency compared to Case R1 in the main channel. Figure 18. Instantaneous concentration flow fields for case R2 A comparison of Cases R1 and R2 highlights the significant impact of discharge locations on fluid dynamics within the confluence channels. In Case R1, the jet is effectively pushed away from the inner bank, facilitating early and efficient mixing because of the increased interaction with the surrounding fluid dynamics. This promotes the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, which enhance mixing. In contrast, the positioning in Case R2 restricts the initial spread of the jet, resulting in a more confined flow pattern that only begins to disperse upon reaching the recovery zone. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 19 of 21 3.3. Timed-averaged Visualization Figure 19 shows the time averaged concentration of case R7 and R8. In R7, initially, the jet moves under the dominance of its momentum. As the jet progresses, it begins to bend along the width of the flume due to the influence of the crossflow current. Over time, the momentum force diminishes, eventually becoming equal to the buoyant force, at which point the jet starts to disperse. A comparison of the impact of discharge location on jet behavior can be summarized as follows: - In Case R7, the jet's movement across the flume width was more pronounced compared to other discharge locations (R8). This is primarily attributed to the wider channel created by the confluence shear layer. - Additionally, in Case R7, the jet exhibited the longest trajectory, allowing for extended interaction with the ambient flow, enhancing mixing and dispersion. Figure 19. Time-averaged concentration filled contours (A) Jet in main channel (case R7) (B) Jet in tributary (case R8). By comparing these two higher velocity ratio jets, a jet released in the main channel as a source of pollutants can dilute over a wider area and more rapidly under the same hydrodynamic conditions than a jet released in the tributary, thereby reducing the environmental impact. 4. Conclusion In this numerical investigation, a comprehensive analysis of effluent discharge in confluence areas was conducted using the LES turbulent model. The study explored jet behavior under varying hydrodynamic conditions, focusing on pollutant distribution and jet trajectories within confluence regions. By extending previous experimental findings, this research provided new insights, particularly into low-velocity discharge scenarios (plume-like jets) that were unattainable in physical models due to instrument limitations. The results showed good agreement between experimental data and numerical models, with an average error of around 4%, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the simulations. Key findings demonstrate that the confluence shear layer significantly impacts jet trajectory, influencing mixing efficiency and pollutant distribution. Jets released in the main channel exhibited longer trajectories and greater interaction with ambient flow, leading to higher dilution rates with both low and high discharge jet. Notably, low- velocity jets (plume-like) were found to be independent of jet velocity upon reaching the confluence, with their path deviating due to the shear layer when discharged in the main channel. In contrast, when released in the tributary, the jet's flow trajectory remained largely unchanged, highlighting the influence of the confluence dynamics. This study underscores the importance of considering confluence hydrodynamics in the design of outfall systems. Numerical simulations provided critical insights into how variations in flow ratios and velocity affect jet behavior, particularly at confluence points. These findings offer valuable guidance for optimizing outfall placement and design to minimize environmental impacts and meet regulatory requirements. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60For Peer Review Page 20 of 21 References Andreopoulos, J., & Rodi, W.
