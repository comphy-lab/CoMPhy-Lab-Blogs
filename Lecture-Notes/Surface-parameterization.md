# Surface Element Parameterization

> [!tldr] TL;DR
> Surface parameterization is a powerful mathematical technique for describing fluid interfaces using coordinates $(u,v)$ that map a 2D parameter space onto 3D surfaces. The tangent vectors $\mathbf{x}_u = \partial\mathbf{x}/\partial u$ and $\mathbf{x}_v = \partial\mathbf{x}/\partial v$ define the local surface geometry and are tangent to curves of constant $v$ and $u$, respectively. The normal vector to the surface is calculated as $\mathbf{n} = (\mathbf{x}_u \times \mathbf{x}_v)/|\mathbf{x}_u \times \mathbf{x}_v|$. This framework enables mathematical analysis of surface metrics like curvature and area, which are essential for understanding interfacial phenomena in multiphase flows, bubble dynamics, and capillary effects.

## Introduction to Surface Parameterization

Interfaces between fluids represent some of the most fascinating and complex phenomena in fluid dynamics. From the gentle ripples on a pond to the intricate dynamics of bubble coalescence, these interfaces require precise mathematical descriptions to understand their behavior. At the heart of this description lies surface parameterization, a technique that allows us to map coordinates from a two-dimensional parameter space onto a three-dimensional surface.

In fluid dynamics, we frequently encounter "sharp" interfaces—surfaces that separate distinct fluid phases, across which physical properties may change discontinuously. This post explores the mathematical framework for describing such interfaces and how we characterize their geometric properties.

## The Fundamentals of Surface Coordinates

### Parameterization Basics

A three-dimensional fluid interface can be mathematically represented by a vector function:

$$\mathbf{x}(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v))$$

Here, $u$ and $v$ are parameters that serve as coordinates on the surface, much like latitude and longitude on Earth's surface. Each point on the interface corresponds to a unique pair of values $(u,v)$ within the parameter domain.

> [!note] Parametric vs. Explicit Representation
> While some simple surfaces can be described explicitly (e.g., $z = f(x,y)$), parametric representation offers greater flexibility for describing complex shapes, especially those with overhangs or multiple-valued functions.

### Iso-Parameter Curves

When we hold one parameter constant while varying the other, we trace curves on the surface known as iso-parameter curves:

- Iso-$u$ curves: Created by keeping $u$ constant and varying $v$
- Iso-$v$ curves: Created by keeping $v$ constant and varying $u$

These curves form a coordinate grid on the surface, as illustrated in Figure 2.

## Tangent Vectors and Their Geometric Interpretation

### Defining Tangent Vectors

When we differentiate the position vector $\mathbf{x}(u,v)$ with respect to the surface coordinates, we obtain two fundamental tangent vectors:

$$\mathbf{x}_u = \frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial u} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{x}_v = \frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial v}$$

These vectors have precise geometric interpretations:

- $\mathbf{x}_u$ is tangent to iso-$v$ curves (curves where $v$ is constant)
- $\mathbf{x}_v$ is tangent to iso-$u$ curves (curves where $u$ is constant)

This is visualized below:

Zaleski, Direct numerical simulations of gas-liquid multiphase flows, Cambridge University Press (2011)](https://books.google.es/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nY5bjSYq-AEC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=%5BBook-Zaleski%5D_Direct+Numerical+Simulations+of+Gas+Liquid+Multiphase+Flows.pdf&ots=TpFXIKxNaj&sig=g-xqzt5uACGx-SYIMhvOwAVtz6U&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)

> [!important] Key Insight
> The tangent vector $\mathbf{x}_u$ points in the direction of increasing $u$ along curves of constant $v$, not perpendicular to iso-$u$ curves. Similarly, $\mathbf{x}_v$ points in the direction of increasing $v$ along curves of constant $u$.

This can be a source of confusion: $\mathbf{x}_u$ is tangent to curves where $v$ is constant, not to curves where $u$ is constant. This is because when you move along a curve where $v$ is fixed, you're varying the $u$ parameter.

### The Surface Normal Vector

With two tangent vectors defined at each point, we can determine the normal vector to the surface through their cross product:

$$\mathbf{n} = \frac{\mathbf{x}_u \times \mathbf{x}_v}{|\mathbf{x}_u \times \mathbf{x}_v|}$$

This unit normal vector is perpendicular to both tangent vectors and thus perpendicular to the surface itself. The normal vector is crucial for calculating quantities like surface curvature and for determining the direction of surface tension forces.

## Surface Element Properties

### Differential Area Element

The differential area element $dA$ on the surface is related to the parameters $du$ and $dv$ through:

$$dA = |\mathbf{x}_u \times \mathbf{x}_v| \, du \, dv$$

The term $|\mathbf{x}_u \times \mathbf{x}_v|$ represents the local scaling factor between the parameter space and the physical surface.

### First Fundamental Form

The first fundamental form characterizes distances and areas on the surface:

$$ds^2 = E \, du^2 + 2F \, du \, dv + G \, dv^2$$

where:
- $E = \mathbf{x}_u \cdot \mathbf{x}_u$
- $F = \mathbf{x}_u \cdot \mathbf{x}_v$
- $G = \mathbf{x}_v \cdot \mathbf{x}_v$

These coefficients completely determine the metric properties of the surface.

> [!note] Orthogonal Parameterization
> When $F = \mathbf{x}_u \cdot \mathbf{x}_v = 0$, we have an orthogonal parameterization, meaning that the iso-parameter curves intersect at right angles. This often simplifies calculations.

## Curvature and Shape Operators

### Mean and Gaussian Curvature

The mean curvature $H$ and Gaussian curvature $K$ are invariant properties of the surface that characterize its local shape:

$$H = \frac{1}{2}(\kappa_1 + \kappa_2) \quad \text{and} \quad K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2$$

where $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are the principal curvatures.

The mean curvature is particularly important in fluid interfaces due to the Young-Laplace equation:

$$\Delta p = 2\gamma H$$

which relates the pressure difference $\Delta p$ across an interface to the surface tension $\gamma$ and mean curvature $H$.

### Shape Characterization

The local shape of a surface element can be categorized based on its curvature:

- Elliptic points: $K > 0$ (bowl-shaped)
- Hyperbolic points: $K < 0$ (saddle-shaped)
- Parabolic points: $K = 0$, $H \neq 0$ (cylindrical)
- Flat points: $K = 0$, $H = 0$ (planar)

These classifications help us understand the geometric behavior of interfaces in various fluid dynamics scenarios.

## Numerical Implementation Considerations

When implementing surface parameterization in computational fluid dynamics, several approaches are commonly used:

1. Finite Element Method: Elements are defined on the parameter space and mapped to the physical surface
2. Level Set Method: Implicit representation of the interface as a level set of a function
3. Front Tracking Method: Explicit tracking of interface points with dynamic remeshing

> [!important] Numerical Stability
> The choice of parameterization can significantly impact numerical stability. Orthogonal parameterizations often provide better conditioning for numerical solvers.

Code snippets utilize these concepts for calculating surface properties:

```c

* @brief Calculates surface curvature from parametric representation
* @param xu First tangent vector
* @param xv Second tangent vector
* @param xuu Second derivative with respect to u
* @param xuv Mixed second derivative
* @param xvv Second derivative with respect to v
* @return Mean curvature value
*/
double mean_curvature(Vector xu, Vector xv, Vector xuu, Vector xuv, Vector xvv) {
    Vector n = normalize(cross_product(xu, xv));
    double E = dot_product(xu, xu);
    double F = dot_product(xu, xv);
    double G = dot_product(xv, xv);
    
    double L = dot_product(xuu, n);
    double M = dot_product(xuv, n);
    double N = dot_product(xvv, n);
    
    return (E*N - 2*F*M + G*L)/(2*(E*G - F*F));
}
```

## Conclusion and Future Directions

Surface parameterization provides a powerful mathematical framework for analyzing fluid interfaces. By defining a mapping between a 2D parameter space and a 3D surface, we gain access to precise geometric tools for calculating properties like curvature, area, and normal vectors.

In research, these concepts have proven invaluable for understanding phenomena ranging from capillary waves in bubble coalescence to complex rheological behaviors in non-Newtonian fluids. Future work will continue to leverage these mathematical tools to explore increasingly complex interfacial dynamics across various fluid systems.

For researchers working in this field, mastering surface parameterization is essential for both theoretical understanding and computational implementation. The framework outlined in this post serves as a foundation for more advanced topics in multiphase fluid dynamics.
