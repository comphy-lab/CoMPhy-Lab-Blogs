# Commonwealth Split-site PhD Scholarships: A Guide from the CoMPhy Lab at Durham University

## Transforming physics research into development impact

The Commonwealth Split-site PhD Scholarship offers an exceptional opportunity for **doctoral candidates** from developing Commonwealth countries to spend **12 months** conducting research at Durham University while maintaining their PhD registration at their home institution. As one of the UK's top physics departments with confirmed Commonwealth Scholarship Commission (CSC) partnership status, Durham provides world-class facilities and expertise perfectly aligned with development-focused research. This guide, prepared by the Computational Matter Physics (CoMPhy) Lab, will help prospective applicants understand this prestigious opportunity and prepare competitive applications.

## Who can apply and from where

The scholarship targets PhD candidates from **42 eligible low and middle-income Commonwealth countries** as classified by the OECD Development Assistance Committee. For a full list of eligible countries, please visit [the list of countries](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/). 

### Eligibility 
Source: [link](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/)

To be eligible, you must already be **registered for a PhD at a university in one of these countries** by September. Academic requirements include holding at least an upper second-class (2:1) honours degree, or a lower second-class degree plus a relevant Master's qualification. Crucially, you must demonstrate that you cannot afford UK study without this scholarship. There are no age limits, but you must be a citizen or have refugee status in an eligible country and have been residing there for at least two years before applying. The most critical eligibility requirement is the **institutional link between your home university and Durham University**. This must be a formal partnership at the departmental or institutional level - not merely a collaboration between individual researchers. Both your home supervisor and proposed Durham University supervisor must provide supporting statements detailing this partnership. 

## Navigate the application timeline and process

Applications usually open annually in **October and close in mid-December** (16:00 GMT) [Britishcouncil](https://study-uk.britishcouncil.org/scholarships-funding/commonwealth-scholarships). 
For example, for the 2025/26 cycle, applications have already closed on December 16, 2024, with results expected by July 2025 for September 2025 start. Mark these dates for future cycles as the timeline remains consistent yearly.

The application process is **entirely online through CSC Central**, the official CSC application system. You apply directly — no nomination from your university or government is required. Start your application at least 6 months before the deadline to allow time for securing supervisor agreements, gathering documents, and crafting your proposal.

Your application journey involves first identifying a Durham University supervisor whose research aligns with your interests, then confirming the institutional link exists between universities. Next, secure supporting statements from both supervisors and gather all required documents. Complete the online application including your research proposal and development impact statement. Upload all documents in the correct format (PDF preferred, maximum 5MB per file) and ensure your referees submit their references by the deadline.

## Compile essential documentation

Documentation requirements are strict - missing or incomplete documents render applications ineligible. You'll need a **passport or national ID** showing your photograph, date of birth, and country of citizenship. Academic documents include complete transcripts for all higher education qualifications with certified English translations if needed [official website](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/).

Reference requirements include **two academic references** submitted directly by referees through the online system, plus supporting statements from both your home supervisor and proposed Durham Universty supervisor. These supervisor statements are critical  they must be on institutional letterhead, signed, and explicitly detail the institutional partnership between universities. Without both statements confirming the institutional link, your application will be considered ineligible. 

Additional documents include your detailed research proposal, a four-part development impact statement, employment history if applicable, and up to 10 publications or prizes if relevant. While no specific English language test is required, all documents must be in English.

## Understanding your funding package

The scholarship provides comprehensive financial support for your 12-month UK stay. 
**Monthly stipend rates for 2025/26** are 1378 GBP for most UK locations or 1690 GBP for London universities. Based on Durham's location, you'll receive the standard rate, which adequately covers living costs in this historic city where accommodation ranges from 174-262 GBP per week in university housing [Link 1](https://uniacco.com/blog/cost-of-living-in-durham) [Link 2](https://en.uhomes.com/uk/durham).

**Full tuition fees** are covered through Durham's part-funding agreement with CSC - you pay nothing. The scholarship includes return economy airfare from your home country to the UK, a warm clothing allowance, and a study travel grant for research-related travel. There are also special provisions. Please visit [Financial assistance, official webpage](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/scholarships/commonwealth-split-site-scholarships-for-low-and-middle-income-countries/) for details. 


## Establishing crucial institutional links

The institutional link requirement is the most common reason for application rejection. Your universities must have a **formal partnership beyond individual researcher collaboration**. Acceptable links include memoranda of understanding between institutions, departmental collaboration agreements, joint research projects, staff exchange programs, or established student mobility frameworks.

Durham Physics has existing partnerships with several Commonwealth universities through various research networks. At the CoMPhy Lab, we maintain collaborations in computational multiphase physics. When approaching us, clearly indicate your home university's existing relationship with Durham University or propose how such a partnership could be established.

Both supervisors must provide detailed statements explaining the nature of the institutional partnership, any history of collaboration, shared resources or facilities, and future partnership plans. These statements must demonstrate that the link exists at an organizational level, not just between individuals. Consider having your department head or international office confirm the partnership formally.

## Crafting a development-focused proposal

Your proposal must demonstrate clear development impact while maintaining scientific excellence. Our research aligns perfectly with several **CSC development themes**, particularly `Science and Technology for Development` through our work in #TODO.


Structure your development impact statement in four parts. 

- First, **identify the problem** (200 words) by linking your research to global, national, and local development challenges. Use recent statistics from credible sources and connect to your chosen CSC theme. For CoMPhy-Lab research interests, this might involve `energy access statistics, technology gaps, or infrastructure challenges in your home country` #TODO.
- Second, explain **skill application** (200 words) by detailing specific capabilities you'll gain at Durham University and how you'll apply them post-award. Be specific about organizations you'll work with and implementation strategies. For CoMPhy Lab research, this could include computational modeling skills, #TODO 
- Third, outline **expected outcomes** (200 words) with specific, measurable results over 1-5 years. Identify clear beneficiary groups and quantify impact where possible. For instance, #TODO improved solar cell efficiency could provide electricity to specific communities, or quantum sensing applications could enhance medical diagnostics in underserved areas.
- Finally, describe **impact measurement** (100 words) including data collection methods, key performance indicators, and reporting mechanisms. Show how you'll track and demonstrate the real-world impact of your research.

## Meeting selection criteria for success

Selection panels evaluate applications using three equally weighted criteria, each accounting for 33% of your score [link](https://cscuk.fcdo.gov.uk/advice-for-applicants/).  

- **Academic merit** assessment considers your degree classifications, research publications, and academic trajectory.  While the minimum is a 2:1 degree, successful candidates often have first-class honours or distinction-level Master's degrees. Your referees should specifically address your intellectual capacity and research potential.
- **Development impact** evaluation examines how clearly you articulate home country needs, the realism of your impact plans, and alignment with CSC themes. Successful applications demonstrate deep understanding of local contexts and propose achievable, measurable outcomes. Generic statements about "helping development" fail — be specific about who benefits and how.
- **Research proposal quality** assessment focuses on scientific rigor, innovation, feasibility, and contribution to both knowledge and development. Your proposal should be accessible to non-specialist reviewers while maintaining scholarly standards. 
 
With success rates typically 5-10%, only the strongest applications combining all three elements succeed.

## Post-scholarship commitments and opportunities

Accepting this scholarship commits you to **return home within one month** of completion. CSC cannot support visa extensions, postdoctoral positions, or remaining for graduation ceremonies. This return requirement ensures you apply your UK-gained knowledge for home country development.

You'll join a vibrant **lifelong alumni network** with immediate access to regional Commonwealth Scholar groups and ongoing engagement opportunities [British council link](https://www.britishcouncil.in/study-uk/scholarships/commonwealth-scholarships).
