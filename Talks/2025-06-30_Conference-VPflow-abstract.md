# Taming singularities: yield-stress regularization in bubble-bursting

Capillary collapse of a bursting bubble is a canonical inertio-capillary singularity: the retracting rim launches a wave packet that focuses at the cavity base, driving a high-speed Worthington jet and, classically, droplets.  Non-Newtonian physics rewrites this script. For example, yield stress and elasticity tame these waves and the jet and often suppress them [1]. Using high-fidelity simulations carried out with _MultiRheoFlow_ (https://comphy-lab.org/MultiRheoFlow/) $-$ a new open-source Basilisk C framework for interfacial flows with arbitrary rheology $-$ we explore how viscoplasticity and its elastoviscoplastic extension regularizes the singular flow. Yield stress intercepts the collapsing wavepacket, arrests curvature blow-up, and suppresses Worthington jetting [2]. In contrast, elasticity relaxation can reopen a singular path, reinstating a solitary jet or droplet [3]. By tracking curvature histories, kinetic–plastic energy exchange, and stoppage times, we build a compact regime map that exposes the mechanical routes by which non-linear rheology regularizes free-surface singularities.  The findings extend beyond bubbles, offering a template for predicting and controlling singular events in yield-stress and other complex fluids.
