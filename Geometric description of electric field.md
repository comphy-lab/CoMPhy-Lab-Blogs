* **Field Lines**: Draw lines so that at each point, their tangent matches the direction of $\vec{E}$
* **Density**: The number of lines per unit area (normal to the lines) is proportional to $\|\vec{E}\|$.
* **Direction**: Arrows on the lines indicate the direction of $\vec{E}$.
* **Interpretation**: This visual map shows both the direction and magnitude of $\vec{E}$ across space.
