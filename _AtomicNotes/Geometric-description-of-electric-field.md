# Geometric description of electric field

* Field Lines: Draw lines so that at each point, their tangent matches the direction of $\vec{E}$
* Density: The number of lines per unit area (normal to the lines) is proportional to $\|\vec{E}\|$.
* Direction: Arrows on the lines indicate the direction of $\vec{E}$.
* Interpretation: This visual map shows both the direction and magnitude of $\vec{E}$ across space.
