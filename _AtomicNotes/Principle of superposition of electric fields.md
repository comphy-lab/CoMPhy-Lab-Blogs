# Principle of Superposition of Electric Fields

The electric field from multiple sources is the vector sum of the individual fields at each point. If charges create electric fields $\vec{E}_1$, $\vec{E}_2$, $\dots$, then the total field is given by:

$$
\vec{E}_{\text{total}} = \vec{E}_1 + \vec{E}_2 + \cdots
$$

This linear superposition implies that each charge’s field contribution adds without altering the others’ fields, enabling straightforward calculation of net electric fields from complex charge distributions.
