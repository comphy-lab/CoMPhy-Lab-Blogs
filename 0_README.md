Welcome to the CoMPhy Lab's documentation hub! We are based at the Physics of Fluids Department at the University of Twente, where we explore non-Newtonian free-surface flows and soft matter singularities.

## About Us

Our research focuses on understanding complex fluid phenomena through computational methods and theoretical modeling. We specialize in:

- Non-Newtonian free-surface flows
- Soft matter singularities
- Computational fluid dynamics
- Multiphase physics
